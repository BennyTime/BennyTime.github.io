The Last Years
-150 to 0 – End of Age of the Shard War
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Shards start destabilizing, making surges of power that alter the world.
The Spirit Realm starts overflowing thanks to the Shard War, making it so some
souls don’t pass on to their next life. This event is later dubbed The Sundering.
Aquaris’ Abyssal Palace separates from the mainland, becoming an underwater
city.
Aerion separates from the earth, creating the current sky islands. In its place, the
lands become a barren desert, later becoming known as Sunscorch Expanse.
Viridalis Isolates themselves from the world, using the Nature Shard’s power to
create the forests that protect it.
The area north to Aerion freezes over thanks to the Ice Shard, later becoming the
Frosthelm Reach.
Erekar start appearing in the world, working as mercenaries that work from the
shadows. Eventually they align themselves with the Umbra Court and the Vanyr.
The Shadow Shard emits the greatest surge of power recorded in history,
creating the veil of darkness over Umbra Court known as the Eternal Night.
The gods remove themselves from the world. Brannok, God of Treaties and
Peace stays behind while trying to mediate and becomes bound to the mortal
world.
The Concordant Plains are formed, becoming the world’s peace hub.
The Vaelari emerge from nowhere. They start stabilizing the shards, an act that
would take 200 years to conclude.
Year 0 marks the formal end of the Shard War, beginning the Early Concordant
Era.

1 to 150 – Early Concordant Era
•
•
•
•
•

Early days of the Concordant Era start off with tension. Nations still don't trust
each other.
To ease the problems, the Eldwyn Vale creates the Adventurer’s Hub and the
Hall of Accord to unite both the leaders and the common man. It works.
Therian villages in Viridalis consolidate under regional lords, forming the
foundation of structured governance amid the chaos.
Kaen no Kuni martial academies are rebuilt under the eye of the Lord of that
time, codifying post-war combat doctrine focused on discipline over conquest.
The first Luxmetal artifacts are forged in Lumineth Sanctum by Forge Priests,
marking the beginning of sanctified material craft.

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The Lumineth Sanctum becomes a Theocracy post the discovery of Luxmetal,
giving its power to the clergy.
A joint Nerai–Hyran maritime council forms to regulate post-war sea routes and
prevent renewed naval conflict.
The first recorded case of Shard-induced mutation is documented in Aetherflux,
prompting stricter ethical guidelines in Shard experimentation.
Concord Bridge is built, connecting the Left continent to the Right one. The first
Concordant Treaty is signed in it.
The Concordant Council quietly debates whether Erekar qualify as a people or a
threat. No consensus is reached; the issue is indefinitely deferred.
Aerion establishes Aerion Prime, training the first Skyserpent riders and
asserting aerial dominance.
Brannok decides to change his domain, becoming the God of Festivities.

151 to 250 – Age of Expansion
•

•
•
•
•

Durakken master-builders begins continent-spanning stone-carving projects in
the Thundarkar Range, including bridges, keeps, and shard-resistant
foundations.
Aetherflux creates on of the biggest points of free knowledge within the world –
the Aetherflux Academy.
The Shadow Rift Exchange expands operations, becoming the single largest
black-market nexus in Vaeloran.
The first stable aerial trade routes open between Aerion and Aetherflux,
revolutionizing long-distance commerce.
Aetherflux starts creating the Valken, automatons that use the souls of the dead
as a power source created to work for the people. Their existence is hated by the
Aelvar.
Eximus, one of the Valken, was tasked with being the Valken’s leader.
Brannok’s festivals spread continent-wide, becoming major cultural
touchstones that soften post-war animosities.
Erekar mercenary companies begin operating outside Umbral Court lands for
the first time, despite Concordant bans.
Kaen no Kuni codifies its Way of Contained Flame, banning conquest-based
warfare.
Shards are finally stabilized thanks to the Vaelari.
Early Vanyr noble houses consolidate power within the Umbral Court,
formalizing hereditary shadow influence.
A failed assassination attempt on an Eldwyn Vale mediator is traced back to
shadow intermediaries, straining Concordant–Umbral relations.

•
•
•
•

The Concordant Council quietly debates limiting Umbral Court representation;
no vote is taken.
Aquaris completes fortified trade routes into Viridalis, enabling sustained naval
commerce.
First interactions with the Gods that separated themselves from the world are
recorded. Beliefs of gods start to grow again.
Eldwyn Vale hosts the First Continental Shard Congress, marking the symbolic
height of cooperation — and the end of unquestioned expansion.

251 to 400 – Age of Skirmishes
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Eximus achieves partial attunement to the Lightning Shard, rebelling against
Aetherflux and igniting a civil war between the Valken and their creators.
Large portions of Aetherflux are devastated by sabotage, rogue constructs, and
unstable aetheric infrastructure, permanently damaging its image as a unified
nation.
Several Aetherflux city-states declare temporary independence to avoid Valken
conscription and soul-binding practices; most are later forcibly reabsorbed.
Frosthelm experiences internal fractures as jarls debate intervention versus
isolation, nearly dissolving the Northern Hall.
Nerai maritime councils impose a short-lived embargo on Aetherflux after
Valken attacks on trade convoys, leading to isolated naval clashes.
Viridalis border wardens clash repeatedly with Erekar mercenary bands moving
through forest fringes, prompting stricter Sylvari isolation.
A Halvyr-led attempt to enforce emergency Concordant law fails when multiple
nations openly refuse compliance, weakening Concordant authority.
Ideological conflict erupts within the Lumineth Sanctum between reformist
clergy and traditional theocrats over the ethics of Luxmetal creation.
Durakken of the Thundarkar Range refuse military construction requests,
declaring neutrality in civil conflicts and straining long-standing alliances.
Internal shadow warfare breaks out within the Umbral Court as factions
assassinate rivals over Erekar loyalty and influence.
Aerion faces internal dissent when younger Windwing riders demand
intervention against Eximus, but elder Skywardens reaffirm neutrality.
Eximus is believed destroyed during a catastrophic Lightning Shard implosion;
his core is presumed annihilated, and the Lightning Shard is once again free.
The Valken civil war abruptly ends, leaving surviving Valken fragmented and
leaderless.
Valken are formally recognized as a people rather than constructs, though many
nations impose strict restrictions on their existence.

•

Widespread belief that the greatest threat has passed marks the end of the Age
of Skirmishes — and the quiet beginning of deeper fractures.

401 to 550 – Age of Fractures
•

•

•
•
•

•

•

•
•
•

•
•
•

•

The Concordant Plains lose their authority as multiple nations openly ignore
rulings, treaties, and mediation efforts, reducing the Concordant Council to a
symbolic body rather than an enforcing power.
Former Valken territories splinter into protectorates, enclaves, and outlaw
zones, with surviving Valken struggling to define identity, rights, and purpose
without a unifying leader.
Internal unrest spreads across major nations as post-war prosperity gives way to
inequality, ideological divides, and political stagnation.
Aetherflux fractures into competing academic factions, some pushing ethical
reform, others secretly continuing soul-based research despite bans.
Lumineth Sanctum experiences its first open schism, as reformist clergy
challenge the absolute authority of Luxmetal-backed theocrats, leading to quiet
purges rather than open war.
Umbral Court influence expands unchecked, but infighting between Vanyr
houses escalates into prolonged shadow conflicts that destabilize their own
power base.
Erekar loyalty becomes fractured; some fully integrate into Umbral Court
hierarchy, while others abandon contracts entirely, becoming feared free
agents.
Viridalis tightens isolation further after several internal revolts, with Sylvari
guardians suppressing dissent to preserve the sanctity of the Verdant Sanctum.
Frosthelm suffers generational divides, as younger jarls push for renewed
alliances while elders cling to isolationist traditions born from the Shard War.
Aerion remains outwardly neutral, but internal philosophical divisions grow
between Skywardens who believe in detachment and riders who believe
vigilance requires intervention.
Trade routes falter as trust erodes, leading to localized famines, economic
downturns, and growing resentment toward former allies.
The Spirit Realm shows signs of instability once more, with Aelvar reporting
irregular soul currents and echoes of unresolved deaths from the Shard War era.
A series of failed summits held in Eldwyn Vale publicly demonstrate the inability
of existing systems to restore unity, cementing the sense that the old order is
broken.
Near the end of the era, a cooperative effort between Aetherflux-Thundarkar
engineers, Lumineth diplomats, and Aerion–Aquaris navigators restores a long-

•

•

broken network of land, sky, and sea routes that had once connected fractured
regions.
Though modest in scale, the success proves that cooperation is still possible —
not through Concordant authority, but through shared necessity and trust
earned through action.
The Age of Fractures ends with cautious optimism, as nations begin to believe
that unity may yet be rebuilt, laying the groundwork for the next era.

551 to 700 – Age of Treaties
•

•
•
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

The Concordant Plains regain prominence as the world’s central neutral ground,
not through authority or force, but through necessity, hosting dozens of bilateral
treaties, trade accords, and non-aggression pacts.
While the Concordant Council lacks enforcement power, its halls become the
default meeting place for resolving disputes too dangerous to ignore.
Lingering fear from the Age of Skirmishes drives nations to favor treaties over
open conflict, even as trust remains fragile and conditional.
Kaen no Kuni emerges as a stabilizing diplomatic force, exporting mediators and
warrior-envoys trained in the Way of Contained Flame, emphasizing restraint,
honor, and limited engagement.
The outer regions of Viridalis, dominated by Therion lords rather than Sylvari
guardians, reopen cautiously to foreign trade, relying on negotiated protections
rather than isolationist force.
Several of these negotiations succeed unexpectedly, often attributed to neutral
intermediaries whose identities are inconsistently recorded across participating
nations.
Historical records from this era contain multiple references to treaty witnesses
whose physical descriptions, race, or origin vary between accounts, a
discrepancy quietly attributed to translation errors or poor documentation.
Lumineth Sanctum scholars expand Shard-detection theory after encountering
sentient beings who fail to register meaningful Shard resonance, classifying
them as rare anomalies rather than threats.
Aetherflux archivists note recurring cases of individuals appearing across
decades under different names and appearances, concluding—officially—that
the phenomenon is the result of identity inheritance or clerical overlap.
Though the organized hunts of earlier eras have ended, cultural fear of “formless
infiltrators” persists in folklore, sermons, and border policies, reinforcing
suspicion of outsiders and travelers.
Brannok’s festivals continue to spread across neutral lands, acting as informal
diplomatic spaces where grudges soften, and negotiations begin away from
council halls.

•

Trade routes stabilize gradually as treaties accumulate, creating fragile but
functional networks of land, sea, and sky commerce once thought permanently
broken.

•

The Age of Treaties ends with the realization that peace is no longer enforced by
Concordant decree, but sustained by shared memory of loss, fear of collapse,
and the quiet labor of those who ensure conflicts end before they begin.

701 to 900 – Age of the Return of Gods
•

•

•

•
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

The gods return to Vaeloran in physical, restrained forms, shaped by mortal
perception and the limitations of their long absence. Though diminished, their
presence is unmistakably divine.
Initial panic spreads across the world as faith becomes reality. Crowds flee,
pray, riot, or gather in awe, unsure whether gods walking the land herald
salvation or judgment.
The fear does not last. The gods act openly and benevolently—healing
wounded lands, calming lingering Shard instabilities, restoring ruined
sanctuaries, and aiding mortals without demanding obedience.
As trust grows, reverence replaces panic. Worship becomes personal again, not
institutional or imposed. Faith is rekindled rather than enforced.
Brannok, already bound to the mortal world, becomes the first point of contact
between gods and mortals—not as a ruler or enforcer, but as a guide to the
changed world.
Brannok explains to the returning gods that Vaeloran has learned to govern itself,
that peace now exists through cooperation rather than divine mandate. The gods
accept this reality, adjusting their roles accordingly.
Concordant Plains become the primary meeting ground between gods and
mortals. Rather than ruling from it, the gods treat it as sacred neutral soil,
reinforcing its role as the world’s center of peace.
Lumineth Sanctum embraces the return as holy affirmation, but is forced to
reform as the gods refuse to legitimize absolute clerical authority, weakening the
Sanctum’s theocratic control.
Kaen no Kuni receives the gods with ritual honor and restraint. Divine presence is
respected, but interference in mortal affairs remains strictly forbidden by
cultural law.
Viridalis reacts in two voices: Sylvari elders resist divine presence as disruptive
to natural balance, while Therion populations welcome the gods as living
stewards and protectors.
Aerion witnesses gods manifesting upon sky-islands and open air, inspiring
renewed spiritual philosophy centered on vigilance rather than worship.

•

Aquaris records the first sustained underwater divine manifestation,
strengthening Nerai faith and transforming sections of the Abyssal Palace into
living sanctuaries.

•

Umbra Court reacts with caution and secrecy. While publicly respectful, Vanyr
houses quietly fear divine scrutiny, and Erekar contracts grow more restrained
under watchful eyes.
Thundarkar Range welcomes the gods as ancient equals. Durakken traditions
treat them as powerful kin rather than masters, leading to mutual respect and
limited cooperation.
Frosthelm Reach greets the gods through ancestral rites. Jarls view their return
as a test of strength and honor, believing divine aid must be earned, not given
freely.
Aetherflux is shaken profoundly. Gods refuse to endorse soul-based
experimentation, forcing the nation to confront its ethical legacy and sparking
renewed reform movements.
The Spirit Realm stabilizes with the return of the Goddess of Finality, who
resumes guiding lost souls and sealing lingering echoes of the Sundering.
Ghostly manifestations decrease across Vaeloran.
Brannok’s role evolves into that of a bridge between eras, reminding gods of
mortal resilience and mortals of divine compassion without supremacy.
Public perception of Brannok shifts fully—from a god who stayed behind, to the
symbol of continuity between divine absence and return.
By the end of the age, gods are no longer distant myths nor absolute rulers. They
are present, limited, compassionate forces—part of the world, not above it.
The era closes with a shared understanding: Vaeloran belongs to mortals, but it
is not abandoned by the divine.

901 to 1000 – Modern Concordant Era
•

•

•

In the early years of the era, scholars and priests independently confirm the
existence of beings older than recorded history — the Daemon, primordial
entities operating through rigid hierarchies, binding clauses, and absolute
enforcement of bargains.
The Daemon intervene directly in mortal affairs for the first time, not through
war, but through contractual reclamation. Ancient agreements, predating even
the Shard War, are invoked and enforced without negotiation.
As a result, Erekar lose their innate ability to forge soul-binding and sin-bound
contracts. The power is not destroyed — it is reclaimed by the Daemon as
proprietary authority.

•

Erekar society undergoes a profound transformation. Stripped of their defining
leverage, many abandon mercenary hierarchies and shadow dominion, slowly
integrating as a more conventional people with culture, family lines, and law.

•

While resentment simmers, widespread conflict does not erupt. Erekar violence
declines, and their reputation shifts from existential threat to wary distrust.
The Umbral Court, having relied heavily on Erekar contract power, suffers a
sharp decline in influence. Vanyr houses turn inward, focusing on political
survival rather than expansion.
The Daemon establish indirect presence across Vaeloran through
intermediaries, clauses embedded in ancient law, and whispers of “binding
precedent.” They do not rule — but their authority is undeniable.
During this period, a previously obscure people step into public awareness: the
Plasari. Known for their mutable forms and resistance to Shard resonance, they
appear across multiple nations simultaneously, claiming long histories within
each.
The revelation causes widespread unease. Records confirm Plasari identities
retroactively, as if they had always been there — neighbors, scholars, merchants
— unnoticed until now.
Unlike Erekar or Valken, Plasari display no inherent connection to Shards,
making them invaluable as mediators, explorers, and neutral observers in a
fractured world.
Academic interest in the Plasari surges, particularly in Aetherflux and Eldwyn
Vale, though Plasari communities remain deliberately decentralized and
resistant to classification.
A catastrophic temporal experiment — its details sealed across all nations —
results in irreversible timeline destabilization, including erased individuals,
contradictory histories, and regions briefly existing in multiple states at once.
In response, the Concordant Council issues the Absolute Temporal Prohibition,
unanimously banning all forms of time magic, chronomancy, retrocausal
divination, and temporal artifact use.
Enforcement of the ban is universal and uncompromising. Even research into
theoretical temporal mechanics becomes grounds for exile, imprisonment, or
erasure from official record.
The Concordant Plains regain renewed importance, not as an enforcer, but as
the sole recognized authority on forbidden practices, maintaining sealed vaults
and black archives inaccessible to all but appointed custodians.
Brannok openly supports the ban, declaring that time is not a resource to be
negotiated, corrected, or conquered — but endured. His stance becomes
doctrine across most nations.

•

•

The Spirit Realm shows subtle signs of strain following the temporal incident,
reinforcing the belief that time manipulation threatens not just mortals, but
existence itself.

•

By the end of the era, Vaeloran is more stable on the surface than it has been in
centuries — yet beneath that stability lie unresolved powers: the Daemon’s
silent authority, the Plasari’s unknown origins, and secrets buried in forbidden
time.
The era closes with a shared understanding: peace now exists, but it is brittle,
and the rules that preserve it are built on fear of what has already gone wrong.

1001 to 1100 – Current Years

•
•
•

•

•

•

•

•

Umbral Court black-market operations surge; high-ranking merchants, scholars,
and diplomats begin disappearing under mysterious circumstances, affecting
multiple nations’ politics and trade.
Gravahlren settlements near Frosthelm report entire hunting and mining parties
vanishing, sparking concern among Frosthelm and nearby Therion traders.
Mysterious phenomena disrupt Skyserpent migrations across Aerion and Aerionadjacent trade routes, impacting aerial commerce with Aetherflux and Aquaris.
Plasari are increasingly spotted in major cities and frontier regions, sometimes
in disguise, creating intrigue, suspicion, and unusual alliances.
Widespread crop failures in parts of Viridalis and southern Frosthelm coincide
with strange weather anomalies, prompting joint investigation from multiple
nations.
The Concordant Plains face internal unrest as minor nations push for
representation and enforcement reforms, threatening the historic role of Eldwyn
Vale as a peace hub.
A Daemon-led intervention curtails Erekar contract powers, causing unrest in
mercenary and espionage networks across multiple nations.
Luxmetal artifacts are stolen from different regions—Aetherflux, Lumineth
Sanctum, and Aquaris—and occasionally resurface in dangerous experiments or
black-market dealings, sparking cross-continental investigations.
Minor temporal disturbances flare in disparate regions, prompting the formal
Absolute Temporal Prohibition, outlawing all time magic under threat of death or
exile.
Ancient ruins and Shard-imbued relics in disparate regions begin spontaneously
activating, attracting scholars, mercenaries, and adventurers, hinting at larger,
unseen threats.
Eldwyn Vale’s Adventurer’s Hub reports a surge of cross-continent expeditions,
as growing uncertainty pushes people to seek protection, knowledge, or profit
beyond their homelands.

Eldwyn Vale establishes cross-regional adventuring parties within the Adventurer’s
Hub, deliberately recruiting individuals from multiple nations and cultures to promote
cooperation, understanding, and shared experience across Vaeloran. These parties
serve as both diplomatic envoys and practical problem-solvers, becoming a subtle but
influential force in maintaining fragile unity.

Current Year: 1109

The World of Vaeloran

The Concordant Plains
Real-World Parallel
Italy / Geneva — Center for diplomacy, commerce, cultural exchange

Geographic Overview
At the center of Vaeloran stretch the fertile Concordant Plains, reborn from the scarred
battlefields of the Grand Divide. Rolling grasslands, clear rivers, and wind-carved ridges
form a land without extremes — fitting for the heart of neutrality. The skies above are
busy with airships and banners of every nation converging upon Eldwyn Vale, the
shining city of peace.

Role in the World
Once a crossroads of war, the Plains became the site of the Treaty of Unity, declaring it
neutral ground for all peoples. Now, it stands as a hub of diplomacy, commerce, and
discovery — where no army may march and no shard may rest. The Wardens of
Concord protect its peace, ensuring that ambition never again breaks its balance.

Culture & Society
The Plains thrive on coexistence. Scholars, artisans, and dreamers from every nation
gather here, bound by shared ideals of progress and unity. Faiths intermingle, magic is
taught freely, and debate replaces battle. Beneath the calm, however, old rivalries
simmer — and the city’s peace depends on constant vigilance.

Important Landmarks
•
•
•
•
•
•

Eldwyn Vale: The capital of peace and cooperation; a city without walls or kings.
Hall of Accord: Circular council chamber where all nations meet as equals.
Scholar’s Promenade: A sprawling quarter of libraries and academies open to
all.
Remnant Gardens: Memorial park blending soil from every nation — a symbol of
shared sacrifice.
Adventurers’ Plaza: Central hub for quests, contracts, and exploration; where
most journeys begin.
Concord Bridge: A monument spanning the river where the armistice was
signed that leads to Eldwyn Vale

Capital – Eldwyn Vale
A marvel of diplomacy and design, Eldwyn Vale stands where armies once clashed —
now rebuilt as a city without walls. The architecture blends every culture in harmony:
marble spires from Luminara beside glass towers from Aetherflux, stone courtyards
grown over with Sylvari vines. Airships drift lazily overhead, ferrying scholars and
merchants from across the world. In its heart lies the Crystal Plaza, a vast circular
square engraved with the symbols of all shards — save one empty space, left for peace
itself.

The Aetherflux Dominion
Elemental Shard: Lightning Shard
Real-World Parallel: A blend of Industrial Revolution–era London and modern America,
with elements of Art Deco futurism.

Geographic Overview
Aetherflux sprawls across a vast, storm-wracked plateau where lightning storms dance
endlessly across metal spires and aetheric towers. The land hums with static energy —
the very air alive with power drawn from the Lightning Shard buried deep beneath its
central city. Rivers of pale-blue current flow through glass conduits, and floating
tramways link massive industrial complexes to towering citadels of learning. Nights are
never dark here; the glow of invention keeps the skies bright.

Role in the World
The Dominion stands as Vaeloran’s crucible of innovation and discovery. It is where
artifice, alchemy, and arcane science meet — the frontier of both knowledge and
danger. While other nations fear the power of the Shards, Aetherflux seeks to master
them. They supply most of the continent’s advanced constructs, aethertech weapons,
and enchanted tools. Their engineers and scholars travel widely, often seen as both
saviors and meddlers.

Culture & Society
Knowledge in Aetherflux is sacred — and free. Its great universities, foremost the
Aetherflux Academy, are open to any who can pass the entrance trials. The people see
ignorance as the only true sin, and learning as the highest virtue.
Society is meritocratic, governed by a council of guilds and scholars rather than
nobility. Valken serve as tireless laborers and assistants, while Eldari push the
boundaries of invention, blending artistry and intellect. However, the endless drive to
progress has begun to strain the balance between machine and soul.

Aetherflux Academy: The greatest university in Vaeloran, devoted to the
unification of magic and science.
Stormspire Core: A titanic aetheric tower channeling lightning from the Shard;
visible from across the Dominion.
Machinal District: The industrial heart, filled with foundries, steam engines, and
automaton workshops.
The Vault of Sparks: A subterranean research facility sealed since the War of
Shards — said to hold failed experiments.

Capital – Arcopolis
A gleaming city of steel and crystal, Arcopolis stands as the embodiment of progress.
Its skyline is dominated by spiraling towers of glass and brass, each housing
laboratories, observatories, or manufactories. Flying trams crisscross the skies, and
mechanical servitors roam its streets. Lightning rods and storm collectors crown every
building, channeling raw power into the city’s radiant grid.

Aquaris, the Rideborn Empire
Elemental Shard: Water Shard
Real-World Parallel: Ancient China and the Tang Dynasty — a civilization of grace,
balance, and hidden depths.

Geographic Overview
Aquaria rests along the southern coasts of Vaeloran, where jade-green cliffs descend
into the endless Sapphire Expanse. The nation is divided between two realms: the
surface harbors and river-cities that cling to the shores, and the vast submerged
metropolises that shimmer beneath the waves. Coral towers and crystal domes form
the undersea capital, linked by glowing canals and bioluminescent thoroughfares. The
Water Shard rests within the Abyssal Palace — a sanctum of living glass beneath the
deepest trench, its pulse said to guide the tides themselves.

Role in the World
Aquaria stands as the spiritual heart of Vaeloran, the keeper of balance and flow. Its
scholars and mystics serve as diplomats, healers, and navigators, their fleets guiding
trade and exploration across the seas. The empire’s deep archives preserve ancient
songs and prophecies dating back before the Grand Divide, many of which foretell the
return of the ocean’s fury should the balance of the elements be broken again. Though
peaceful by nature, Aquaria’s mastery of the tides makes it a formidable power, its
fleets capable of striking silently from the depths.

Culture & Society
The Aquarian people live by the belief that every soul is a droplet in the greater ocean of
existence — destined to flow, merge, and eventually return to the source. Central to
this philosophy is the pursuit of Ascendance, the long-held belief that through
enlightenment, devotion, and harmony with water’s essence, one may transcend the
mortal form and become a Nerathi — a radiant being of pure light and current, said to
dwell in the deepest sanctuaries of the sea.
This pursuit shapes all of Aquaria’s culture: art mirrors the ebb and flow of water;
meditation is done to the rhythm of the tides; and those nearing enlightenment are
venerated as living saints. Yet, beneath this serene ideal lies quiet tension — the

pressure to achieve transcendence divides the faithful from those who simply wish to
live mortal lives.

ancient sea spirits.
Moonmirror Port: A surface harbor where the reflection of the full moon is used
in ritual divination.
The Depthless Sanctum: A forbidden abyss said to be home to the Nerathi —
the enlightened souls who transcended mortality.

Capital – Namaris
Hidden beneath the tranquil surface of the Sapphire Expanse, Namaris is a
breathtaking undersea city of coral spires, living crystal, and drifting lanterns. The
rhythm of its tides dictates daily life — work, prayer, and rest all flow with the ocean’s
pulse. Songs of whales and soft bells echo through its domes, blending into a ceaseless
hymn to the sea. Above it, shimmering currents weave through the water like threads of
silk, carrying messages and travelers between the surface and the depths.

Frosthelm stretches across snow-laden mountains, frozen tundras, dense taiga
forests, and icy river valleys. Rolling plains and deep forests provide hunting grounds,
while the Glacier Spire, the resting place of the Ice Shard, dominates the horizon.
Aurora-filled nights illuminate frozen lakes, and small settlements cling to rivers and
forests where resources are most abundant. The landscape blends the stark grandeur
of Scandinavia with the vast expanse and harsh winters of Siberia.

Role in the World
Frosthelm is Vaeloran’s bastion of endurance and fortitude. Its people are unmatched
in navigating snow, ice, and forested terrain, excelling in survival, hunting, and defense.
While outsiders may see them as austere or stoic, Frosthelm’s warriors and tacticians
are essential allies in times of war, and their wisdom is often sought for navigating harsh
climates.

Culture and Society
Life in Frosthelm demands discipline, cooperation, and respect for the cold’s power.
Communities revolve around extended clans, where elders teach survival, combat, and
craftsmanship. Fire and ice are central motifs in festivals and storytelling, celebrating
past victories and winter endurance rituals.
Architecture fuses Nordic longhouses and watchtowers with Russian-style onion
domes and decorative woodwork, particularly in temples, halls, and council buildings.
Music, chanting, and epic poetry preserve history, and warm communal halls serve as
cultural hubs during the long winters.
Religious and spiritual life emphasizes harmony with the ice and forest spirits,
endurance, and the idea that strength is shown through resilience rather than
conquest.

Kaen no Kuni
Elemental Shard: Fire Shard
Real-World Parallel: Feudal Japan — disciplined, honor-bound, and militarily
advanced

Geographic Overview
Ignareth stretches across volcanic highlands, dense bamboo forests, and terraced
hills. Rivers of molten rock flow through certain regions, shaping the land into natural
fortresses and sacred sites. The sky is often tinged with ash and smoke, giving the lands
a fierce, fiery atmosphere. Mountain passes and coastal ports serve as trade and
defense points, while cherry blossom groves and tranquil temples contrast the
otherwise harsh terrain.

Role in the World
Ignareth is the continent’s martial heart, home to strict codes of honor, guilds of
artisans, and disciplined armies. The Korveth dominate governance, enforcing law and
tradition, while the Dravari (especially fire-adapted clans) serve as warriors, guardians,
and emissaries. Its position atop the Fire Shard makes it a source of magical power and
conflict, often supplying elite soldiers or mercenaries across Vaeloran.

Culture & Society
Society revolves around hierarchy, respect, and discipline. Clan loyalty is paramount,
and each citizen’s duty defines their social standing. Martial arts, swordsmanship, and
elemental mastery are taught from a young age. Art and poetry flourish alongside war,
reflecting a culture of beauty intertwined with strength. Festivals honor the Fire Shard
and ancestral spirits, combining pageantry with martial demonstrations.

Viridalis Expanse
Elemental Shard: Nature Shard
Real-World Parallel:
•
•

Outer Region: Rural Alentejo Portugal (1970s–80s agricultural countryside)
Inner Region: Mesoamerican ritual culture fused with ancient, sacred forest
(not jungle-heavy, more primordial woodland)

Geographic Overview
The Viridalis Expanse stretches across sun-warmed plains, cork forests, olive groves,
vineyard-dotted hills, and winding rivers reminiscent of the rural Mediterranean. The
outer lands are open, golden, and pastoral — home to quiet Therion villages and
farmlands that supply much of Vaeloran’s grain and produce.
But at the center lies an entirely different world.
Deep within the heart of the Expanse rises the Verdant Sanctum, a colossal, untouched
primordial forest where ancient trees tower like natural cathedrals. Their canopies blot
out the sky, and their roots form tunnels, bridges, and living halls. This inner region is
the sacred domain of the Sylvari — guarded, mystical, and shaped directly by the
Nature Shard’s presence.
The two realms coexist in balance yet remain distinct:
the humble rural frontier and the enchanted, ancient forest within.

Role in the World
The Expanse is Vaeloran’s agricultural heart, its fertile climate nourishing fields,
orchards, and medicinal groves. The outer lands welcome trade, travelers, and
scholars of herbal medicine.
The inner woods, however, are among the most protected places on the continent. The
power of the Nature Shard makes the Verdant Sanctum a wellspring of living magic —
influencing seasons, wildlife, and the vitality of soil across Vaeloran. Druids,
spiritualists, and elemental scholars regard it as the closest thing to a living miracle.
The Expanse is often seen as Vaeloran’s pulse: steady, grounding, and life-giving, yet
capable of overwhelming force when its balance is threatened.

Culture & Society
Outer Region — The Therion Frontier
Life follows the rhythm of the sun. Communities are humble and hardworking, valuing
family, agriculture, and craftsmanship. Taverns serve strong wines and hearty stews,
musicians play rustic string instruments, and festivals celebrate harvests, rain, and
ancestral spirits.
The people are known for warmth, hospitality, and a deep bond with the land. Tradition
is strong, and superstition runs deep — especially warnings never to enter the inner
forest without permission.

Inner Region — The Sylvari Sanctum
The inner region is a sanctified ancient forest-kingdom where every leaf is sacred.
Towering trees rise higher than any mortal-built structure, their branches forming
interconnected pathways and spiraling sanctuaries. Sunlight barely reaches the
ground, replaced by emerald twilight and glimmering flowers.
Here, the Sylvari maintain a ceremonial culture inspired by ancient Mesoamerican
ritual practice — but shaped entirely through nature, not stone:
•
•
•

temples are living, spiraling root-structures
altars bloom from giant flowers or moss-covered roots
councils meet in canopy halls grown from braided branches

Stone exists only in fragments — old foundations long ago embraced by roots and
moss.
Rituals, dances, and druidic magic all serve one purpose: to protect the forest’s
balance and the Nature Shard that sustains it.
Outsiders rarely see this place. Those allowed in are watched by both Sylvari and the
forest itself.

Important Landmarks

The Elderbloom Ziggurat: Formerly a stone pyramid ages ago, it is now
completely consumed by the Elderbloom tree. Roots have split the old stone
and grown through it, reshaping the once-angular structure into a breathtaking
living monument, glowing with emerald light. It is the holiest place in the
Expanse.
The Corkgrove Villages: Therion settlements surrounded by vineyards, cork
forests, and rolling farmland.
The Whispering Plains: A wide field where wind through tall grass is said to
carry messages from forest spirits.
The River Solenne: A long, peaceful river that nourishes farms before
disappearing into the jungle’s depths.

Capital – Verdancia
As Verdancia transitions inward, the city dissolves into the living forest. Stone streets
fade into soft moss paths, and buildings shift into homes grown from hollowed trunks
or flowering canopies. Bridges of braided vines sway gently between massive branches,
and lanterns of bioluminescent petals illuminate the spiraling paths.
At the very center stands the Elderbloom, a colossal tree whose roots cradle the Nature
Shard in a hollow of glowing amber. Its branches form a cathedral-like vault overhead,
leaves shimmering with soft emerald luminescence.
This heart-forest is silent, sacred, and alive — the spiritual core of the Sylvari and the
living soul of the Expanse.

The Umbra Court
Elemental Shard: Shadow Shard
Real-World Parallel: Aristocratic France (1600s–1700s) - dueling noble houses, salons
of manipulation, velvet decadence, masks and intrigue

Geographic Overview
The Umbral Court is a land forever cloaked beneath the Eternal Night, a ceaseless
darkness cast by the Shadow Shard itself. The sun never touches the region; “day” is
merely a faint violet glow, “night” a deep obsidian suffusion. Fog drifts endlessly
through shadowed forests, rivers appear as ribbons of black glass, and ancient
mountains loom like silent sentinels.
This perpetual twilight has shaped the land. Trees grow pale, wildlife adapts to
dimness, and shadows seem almost alive. Villages cluster around lantern wards, and
vast estates rise like monuments in the gloom. At the center lies the Shadow Rift, a
jagged chasm from which the Shard’s darkness flows, anchoring the Eternal Night
above the entire nation.

Role in the World
Umbral Court is Vaeloran’s epicenter of secrecy, intrigue, and forbidden knowledge.
The Vanyr and Erekar have made the Eternal Night their advantage. Scholars, spies, and
adventurers alike seek the Court’s expertise, whether to learn shadowcraft, broker
clandestine agreements, or harness powers others’ fear.
The Court controls night-based trade routes invisible to the outside world, and its
operatives navigate borders unseen. While other nations distrust the Court, none can
ignore its influence: their spies are everywhere, and their knowledge of forbidden arts
unmatched.

Culture & Society
The Eternal Night dictates every facet of life. Markets open at twilight, celebrations
occur under candlelit pavilions, and fashion favors dark fabrics threaded with
protective wards. Superstition is universal, prayers are whispered to shadows, and
music, dance, and poetry are infused with the themes of dusk, memory, and hidden
power.
The Vanyr flourish here, their vampiric forms able to roam freely at all hours. They
dominate aristocratic society, holding salons, midnight operas, and dueling
tournaments in eternal darkness. The Erekar, demonic enforcers and warriors, draw
strength from the gloom, their senses and magic sharpened by the Shard’s influence.
Power in Umbral Court is divided among the Five Great Families, each plotting,
scheming, and maneuvering to assert dominance while maintaining the fragile balance
that the Eternal Night requires:
•
•
•
•
•

House Noctavera – Masters of illusion, controlling communication within
shadows.
House Draegoth – Erekar warmasters, excelling where war hides in darkness.
House Valcienne – Merchants of clandestine luxury and forbidden goods.
House Mor’Khal – Archivists and shadow-priests who study the Eternal Night.
House Sanguir – Oldest Vanyr lineage, rumored to be directly bound to the
Shard.

These families are locked in a perpetual struggle, their ambitions hidden behind ornate
masks, shadowed gardens, and cryptic etiquette.

Important Landmarks

The Shadow Rift: Chasm where the Shadow Shard anchors the Eternal Night;
darkness pulses visibly from its depths.
The Obsidian Courts: Gothic palace complex where mirrors seem bottomless

forbidden to outsiders.
Moonquill Manor: Floating estate bathed in violet light, drifting through the
Eternal Night like a ghost.
The Crypt Archives: Labyrinthine libraries, tombs, and shadow-forges where
forbidden knowledge is preserved.

Capital - Umbramir
Umbramir rises like a cathedral of darkness, its spires piercing the violet haze of Eternal
Night. Lanterns of pale ghostfire illuminate streets while shadows drift independently,
moving like sentient guides. Gothic mansions, vaulted halls, and hidden courtyards give
the city an air of beauty intertwined with menace.
The heart of Umbramir holds the Ebon Throne, shrouded in a pillar of unbroken
darkness, the epicenter of the Shadow Shard’s power. Few have approached it and
fewer have returned. The city embodies the Court itself: a delicate balance of elegance,
cunning, and danger, where every whisper could change the fate of nations.

Lumineth Sanctum
Elemental Shard: Light Shard
Real-World Parallel: Italy / Vatican — a theocratic and artistic heart of religion, culture,
and divine authority

Geographic Overview
The Lumineth Sanctum occupies a radiant plateau bathed in perpetual sunlight, where
rolling golden fields meet pristine marble cliffs. Rivers of clear water reflect the sky like
mirrors, while Luxmetal-clad spires gleam across the horizon. The land is warm yearround, touched by soft winds said to be guided by the Light Shard’s blessing.
The Shard’s cathedral-city sits at the highest point of the plateau, its brilliance visible
from miles away — a beacon of both hope and authority.

Role in the World
The Sanctum is Vaeloran’s foremost religious power — a theocracy that claims divine
stewardship over truth, purity, and righteous order. It houses the Church of the Eternal
Radiance, whose high clergy wield political influence rivaling any kingdom.
While many trust in its guidance, others whisper about its rigid doctrine, zealous
inquisitors, and ambitions to “illuminate” all realms. Luxmetal artifacts and radiant
warriors make it one of the most respected — and feared — nations on the continent.

Culture & Society
Life in the Sanctum revolves around faith and ritual. Citizens rise with morning hymns
echoing through marble streets. Markets sell Luxmetal trinkets and holy oils. Artistic
expression flourishes through radiant murals, hymns, and luminous glasswork.
Hyran form the majority: devout, disciplined, culturally refined. Halvyr, though only 20%
of the population, hold exalted status as divine-born heralds of the Light; many serve as
judges, paladins, or shard-wardens. Pilgrims from all nations travel here to witness
Luxmetal wonders or seek absolution.
Yet there is tension: the hierarchy is strict, justice often unyielding, and doctrinal
dissent is quietly (or not-so-quietly) purged.

Luxmetal — Heart of the Sanctum
The Sanctum’s identity revolves around Luxmetal, the sacred alloy of gold and silver
infused with Light Shard radiance.
Luxmetal serves as:
•
•
•

the core of holy armors worn by Halvyr paladins
the material for sacred relics and ceremonial weaponry
architectural adornment for cathedrals and sanctuaries

•

the ultimate symbol of divine authority

Only those ordained or blessed may wield Luxmetal arms. Its glow is said to repel
corruption and reveal deception — a metaphor the Sanctum takes literally.
Luxmetal’s rarity ensures that its use is carefully controlled by the church,
consolidating their influence over warriors, nobles, and foreign dignitaries.

Important Landmarks

Solenne Radiant Ba silica – A colossal Luxmetal cathedral built around the
Light Shard. Its dome shines like a miniature sun, visible for leagues.
Cathedral of the Eternal Radiance: A titanic holy complex housing relics,

Auric Forge of Twinfire: The only forge capable of creating Luxmetal. Entry is
restricted to master artisans and sainted smiths.
The Pilgrim’s Gallery: A long colonnade depicting the Sanctum’s history in
Luxmetal reliefs, glowing softly at dusk.

Capital – Solenne
Solenne is a masterpiece of holy design — a city of gleaming Luxmetal domes, radiant
plazas, and marble avenues arranged in a perfect sunburst pattern.At its center, the
Radiant Basilica rises like a second dawn, its Luxmetal spires refracting light into
dancing halos that glide across the streets.
Templars patrol in mirrored armor, choirs sing hymns at every hour, and pilgrims from
all nations fill the grand squares. At night, the city does not fall dark — soft golden light
radiates from the Basilica, washing Solenne in a perpetual twilight glow. Solenne is
beauty, discipline, and divine judgment made manifest.

Aerion Skydrift
Elemental Shard: Air Shard
Real-World Parallel: Zelda: Skyward Sword (Skyloft) + Tibetan mountaintop temples +
skyfaring fantasy

Geographic Overview
Aerion Skydrift is an archipelago of floating islands suspended high above the world,
drifting like emerald clouds over a vast desert known as the Sunscorch Expanse. The
desert below stretches endlessly — a shimmering wasteland of golden dunes, sunbaked canyons, and swirling dust storms that claw at the sky. It is said the Air Shard’s
awakening long ago fractured the land, uplifting the islands into the heavens and
leaving the surface scorched and unstable.
Above this desert ocean float hundreds of islands both small and grand. Waterfalls
cascade into thin air, dissolving into mist only to be carried upward on the constant
warm updrafts rising from the sands. Cloud reefs, floating stones, and natural
skybridges make the skies feel alive with movement.
The lowest islands skim the upper heat haze of the Expanse; the highest rest in gentle,
eternal winds. Below everything lies the Azure Expanse of Sand, where storms brew
without warning, swallowing caravans, ruins, and entire dunes in moments.
Travel between islands is done by Windwings, Skyserpents, or gliders carried by the
endless winds. Few dare descend to the desert without proper training.

Role in the World
Aerion is Vaeloran’s airborne guardian, soaring far above the conflicts of the surface
world. Its riders patrol trade routes and skies alike, ensuring safe passage for airships
that cross nations. While politically aloof, Aerion commands enormous respect — their
intervention in times of crisis is swift and decisive.
The desert below forms a natural barrier. Only sacred descent paths allow access to
the ground, and even then, only trained Aerion riders or desert-adapted nomads
traverse the shifting sands safely. This isolation has kept Aerion’s culture pristine and
its people protected.
For pilgrims and scholars, Aerion is a place of ascension — literally and spiritually.
Many journey here seeking wisdom, clarity, or communion with the Sky Mother.
Windspire Academy draws aeromancers from across Vaeloran who hope to master the
art of wind.

Culture & Society
Life among the clouds is shaped by freedom, balance, and the constant breath of the
wind. The Dravari Air Clans — graceful, sky-attuned dragonfolk — form the heart of
Aerion’s identity. Homes cling to cliff edges or hang from massive roots and rock
columns, painted in soft sky hues and adorned with banners and windbells that sing
with the breeze.
The Sky Mother Aeria, patron of clarity and harmony, guides Aerion’s spiritual
philosophy. Festivals involve aerial dances, floating lanterns, and rituals performed at
dizzying heights. To fall is not tragedy but a passage — the winds catch those who trust
them, and those who don’t are honored as part of the cycle.
Because the ground below is deadly, Aerion sees itself as the last refuge of the sky.
Their culture values lightness — of spirit, of conflict, of burden. Many Aerion people
believe their ancestors were guided into the air to escape a great cataclysm of the
sands.

with mirages, fallen ruins, and storm-beasts.

Capital - Aerion Prime
Aerion Prime, the crown jewel among the islands, floats closest to the Eye of Aeria — a
swirling vortex of living wind that houses the Air Shard. Terraces ring its cliffs in spirals,
while windmills and aetherglass towers catch the eternal breeze. Skyships drift
between its docks, built into arches suspended high above the desert sands.
The Sky Mother’s Basilica dominates the skyline, its feathered spires glinting in the sun.
Beneath it lies the Vortex Heart, a resonant chamber where the winds sing in harmony,
revealing the presence of the Air Shard deep within the island.
Aerion Prime gently rotates on the sky currents, giving its streets and gardens a

Thundarkar Range
Elemental Shard: Earth Shard
Real-World Parallel: Swiss Alps grandeur fused with Tibetan verticality, Mongolian
resolve, and the architectural marvel of impossible dwarven megastructures.

Geographic Overview
The Thundarkar Range is a kingdom of mountains that should not exist — jagged peaks
rising at angles that seem to mock gravity; cliff faces suspended in perfect symmetry,
and plateaus carved so precisely they almost appear artificial. The land itself bears the
unmistakable touch of the Earth Shard; stone here is not just matter but memory,
shaped by ancient hands and living resonance.
Massive arches of seamless granite bridge valleys miles across. Entire mountainsides
have been hollowed out into spiraling cities, their surfaces etched with runic geometry
that glows faintly at dusk. Waterfalls plunge from impossible angles, splitting into mist
midair before rejoining in perfect harmony.
Tremors echo constantly beneath the stone, not violent but rhythmic — the steady
heartbeat of the mountains themselves.

Role in the World
Thundarkar is the architectural and structural backbone of Vaeloran. The continent’s
greatest fortresses, aqueducts, keeps, bridges, shrines, and monuments were
designed by Durakken stonewrights and carved from Thundarkari stone. Their
constructions are so precise and enduring that other nations often believe them to be
magical in nature.
The Range exports unbreakable stone, gravity-defying constructs, rune-engineered
frameworks, and earth-attuned artisans capable of shaping entire landscapes. Where
others see rock, the Durakken see potential.
Though slow to involve themselves in politics, their mastery makes them indispensable
and their approval, or disapproval, can shift the balance of entire nations.

Culture & Society
Thundarkari society is built on craft, patience, and monumental design. Every
settlement is both a home and a masterpiece, each block carved to fit a cosmic rhythm
known to the Durakken as the Stone Song - the belief that all stone has a true form
waiting to be revealed.
Stonewrights are held in the highest honor. Architects are treated as philosophers.
Engineers are revered as spiritual guides.
Every generation strives to build something that will last until the end of ages, and their
structures often incorporate feats that defy ordinary engineering:
•
•

suspended bridges with no visible supports
inverted towers spiraling downward into the mountain

•
•

citadels balanced atop needle-thin pillars
entire cities carved into the undersides of cliffs

Their religion centers on Stonefather Grondyr, the first shaper, who taught the
mountains to stand and the earth to breathe. Artistic expression takes the form of
sculpture, runic murals, and harmonic lithophone music played upon resonant stone
slabs. Community life is disciplined but warm; taverns echo with laughter, boasting
contests, and tales of earth-shaping miracles.

Important Landmarks

Gronndel Cradle – The impossible cavern where the Earth Shard rests, its

Echoing Deep – A runic labyrinth whose walls resonate with harmony when
walked in certain patterns.
The Tectonic Lake – A lake made from the impact of a meteor from long ago.
Pillars of Orun – Natural stone columns reshaped into towering sanctuaries and
homes, stretching miles into the air.

Capital - Stoneheart Hold
Stoneheart Hold is carved not upon a mountain, but within a mountain that has been
reshaped into a living monument. From afar it appears as though the peak has been
sculpted by divine chisels: tiered terraces, spiraling towers, and massive open windows
carved directly into the stone.
Inside lies a vertical city that descends for miles. Light is carried deep within through
crystalline shafts that refract sunlight into kaleidoscopic brilliance. Bridges crisscross
open spaces carved from the heart of the mountain, some suspended by nothing but
runic intention.
At the center of all things rests the Grand Litharium, a vast circular hall where stone
sings under the touch of artisans, engineers debate over designs that span decades,
and oaths are carved into the Pillar of Truth — a monolith said to crumble only when a
sworn promise is broken. The entire city stands as the Durakken’s greatest declaration:
“Stone does not bend to the impossible — it creates it.”

Spirit Realm
Geographic Overview
The Spirit Realm is a dimension layered atop Vaeloran like a translucent veil — neither
distant nor reachable by ordinary means. Its landscapes defy physical law: rivers
flowing upward into glowing basins, mountains dissolving into petals, and starlit fields
blooming with emotion-sensitive flora. Every surface hums with gentle spiritual
resonance. But its most defining feature lies deeper: This is where all souls go when
their mortal journey ends.
Every life — whether saint, tyrant, beast, or king — converges toward the Spirit Realm in
a drifting stream of luminous essence. These soul-rivers wander the realm like celestial
currents, carrying memories and emotion into the great cycle of rebirth.
Only the Aelvar can traverse the realm freely, their own essence naturally attuned to its
tides. Others who enter without guidance may fall into dreams, illusions, or the echomaze of their own unresolved spirit.

Role in the World
The Spirit Realm is Vaeloran’s spiritual engine — the silent mechanism through which
life, death, and rebirth are maintained. The Aelvar do not rule it so much as shepherd
its balance.
Here, souls:
• Release their burdens
• Merge with the flow of life-energy
• Are guided back into the mortal world
• Or remain, becoming spirits, guardians, or echoes
During the War of Shards, this delicate flow nearly collapsed. Too many lives were cut
short, emotions tore violently through the veil, and soul-streams fragmented. The
Aelvar’s intervention prevented total spiritual collapse — a truth known only to a
handful outside their realm.
To the mortal nations, the Spirit Realm is myth. To the Aelvar, it is sacred duty. To every
soul, it is home.

Culture & Society
Aelvar culture revolves around three eternal principles that bind them to their duty as
custodians of the soul-flow:
Reflection — accepting one’s past, so the spirit may move freely
Resonance — aligning one’s essence with the greater harmony
Transcendence — becoming a guide for others on the cycle of existence
Their settlements are serene sanctuaries floating between reality and dream.
Spiritforged bridges connect shrines shaped from moonlight and memory. Blossoms
fall eternally yet never land, swirling in currents of emotion.
Aelvar are peaceful, but not helpless. Their warriors — the Soulbound Sentinels — wield
spirit-tempered weapons that alter form with the wielder’s emotional state. Their
healers mend both body and soul. They rarely intervene in mortal affairs, but when the
balance of souls is threatened, the Aelvar act through subtle dreams, whispers, or the
rare envoy.

Creators
They who have created everything.

Aionyx, the Still Axis
The unmoving point around which all moments turn. Aionyx does not rule the future or
the past — he halts them. In his presence, all things are fixed, observed, and weighed. It
is said that history exists only because Aionyx allows it to resume.

Vaelthra, the Infinite Womb
The first expanse and the final horizon. Vaelthra shaped distance, direction, and
possibility, allowing existence to separate from itself. Every realm, plane, and world
rests within the vastness she continuously unfolds.

Divinities
Gods below the creators who are tasked to control their domains.

Nyssara, the Final Quiet (Goddess of Finality - Aelvar)
Nyssara governs endings without cruelty or mercy. Death, closure, and completion fall
under her gaze. She ensures that what must end does so cleanly, allowing the soul to
move onward without echo or regret.

Veridan, the Returning Bloom (God of Renewal – Sylvari)
Veridan presides over rebirth, restoration, and the turning of cycles. Where something
has ended, he ensures something new may rise — not the same, but renewed. His
patience made divine.

Kaelor, the Full Measure (God of Abundance –Therian)
Kaelor embodies surplus, plenty, and thriving life. He does not create growth, but
rewards harmony and balance with overflowing bounty. To take more than one’s share
is to fall from his favor.

Varkuun, the Iron Trial (God of Strife – Korveth)
Varkuun rules conflict, struggle, and opposition. He believes growth is forged only
through resistance. War, rivalry, and adversity are his proving grounds — not for
destruction, but for refinement.

Lirienne, the Farbound (Goddess of Travels – Nerai)
Lirienne watches over journeys, passages, and movement between places. Roads,
currents, winds, and safe crossings fall under her care. Every traveler unknowingly
walks within her sight.

Marthisa, the Golden Accord (Goddess of Commerce – Hyran)
Marthisia governs trade, exchange, and agreement. Coin, contracts, and negotiation
are her tools. Prosperity comes not from greed, but from fair and willing exchange.

Brannok, the Joyous Roar (God of Festivities – Gravahlren)
Brannok celebrates laughter, feasts, song, and shared revelry. He reminds mortals that
joy itself is sacred, and that unity is forged not only in hardship, but in celebration.

Saelyth, the Veiled Mind (Goddess of Knowledge – Vaelari)
Saelyth is the keeper of truth, memory, and understanding. Knowledge is neither good
nor evil to her — only preserved. Secrets are hers to guard, not to judge.

Dhoram, the First Hand (God of Arts – Durakken)
Dhoram shaped beauty from intention. Art, architecture, design, and creation flow
through his domain. He teaches that meaning is carved, painted, sung, or forged into
existence.

Halcion, the Unbroken Line (God of Order – Halvyr)
Halcion governs law, structure, hierarchy, and balance. He does not punish — he
corrects. To him, order is not oppression, but clarity given form.

Eryndra, the Burning Pulse (Goddess of Passion – Erekar)
Eryndra embodies intensity: love, rage, devotion, ambition, and desire. She teaches
that passion is neither virtue nor vice — it is the force that drives all action.

Somnyr, the Sleepless Star (Goddess of Dreams – Dravari)
Somnyr reigns over dreams, visions, and the realm of the sleeping mind. She speaks in
symbols and omens, guiding souls through the quiet spaces between thought and
reality.

In Frosthelm, there’s a tale of the Glass Wolf: a spectral wolf that walks across
frozen lakes. Seeing it is said to bring either a great blessing or a winter of
endless blizzards.
Aerion’s high skies are rumored to hide islands that only appear when the Eye of
Aeria opens. Pilots who search for them never return, or so the story goes.
The Concordant Plains supposedly have a hidden library, “The Endless Stack,”
where every treaty ever broken writes itself in ink that glows faintly in moonlight.
Deep in the Veilwood Forest of the Umbra Court, it is said a single tree moves
every night to hide a treasure chest full of forbidden knowledge. The chest is
cursed, though, and opening it without permission can erase one’s shadow.
Some say the Daemon occasionally leave tokens in the mortal world which grant
a small boon but mark the recipient for future debt.
Many believe that each Elemental Shard grants its bearer immense power over
its element, though attempts to wield them without proper attunement often
lead to disaster.
Legends claim a beast called the Ironback Drake roams the Thundarkar Range. It
is said its scales are indestructible, and any who ride it are doomed to vanish
into the mountains forever.
In Aquaris, sailors tell of the Moonwhale: a luminescent sea creature that
appears once every decade and can whisper the future to those who catch it.
Aetherflux inventors tell of the Clockwork Menagerie, a hidden factory said to
create sentient automata that vanish when humans approach. Some believe it
was built by scholars who tried to outsmart death.
Kaen no Kuni clans tell the story of the Fire Spirit of Korveth-Kami, a wandering
flame that tests the honor of warriors. Those who fail are consumed in spirit, not
body, leaving behind a walking soulless husk.
There are rumors of a Shard Convergence, when multiple Shards align. It is said
that the world itself trembles and new lands or creatures may appear.
Verdalia’s Sylvari are rumored to hold a grove where shadows bloom into flowers
at night. Anyone who picks one may find themselves walking in dreams rather
than reality.
A common tavern tale warns of the Lost Airship of Solenne: a vessel that
appeared once over the Concordant Plains, carrying a cargo of Luxmetal that no
one has ever recovered.
Some say there is a River of Stars in Aerion that only flows during eclipses.
Anyone who steps into it is granted the memory of a life they never lived.
Some sages claim that each Shard has a will of its own, as if they can hear, feel,
think.

Word of mouth says that users of time magic still exist in the current era, hidden
from the world.

Practical Knowledge for Adventurers
Travel & Transportation
•
•
•
•

Airships and Windwings are the fastest way to cross Vaeloran’s major nations,
but tickets are expensive and often require permits for shard-adjacent regions.
Roads can be treacherous; bandit activity is common, especially on the left
continent.
Tides, storms, and magical phenomena may make travel unpredictable near
Aquaria, Aerion, and Thundarkar Range.
The Concordant Plains are neutral; travelers should respect local rules or face
fines, imprisonment, or diplomatic complications.

Currency & Trade
•
•

•

After the end of the Shard War, a unified currency was created – the
Black market trades are rumored everywhere, but discretion is critical.
Contracts with shadowy groups like Daemon intermediaries are legally binding
and rarely forgiving.
Shard-related items are tightly controlled. Selling or transporting them illegally
can incur extreme penalties.

Combat & Hazards
•
•
•

•

Magical anomalies are common near Shards; elemental surges may occur
randomly.
Necromantic and soul-related magics are dangerous and socially unacceptable;
even possessing unbound talismans may bring suspicion.
Monster knowledge is invaluable: even minor threats like shadow wolves in
Umbral Court or sand wyrms in the Sunscorch Expanse can kill unprepared
adventurers.

Social Norms & Etiquette
•
•
•
•

In Kaen no Kuni, honor and fire rites dictate interactions. Insulting a clan or
refusing a duel can have severe consequences.
In Umbral Court, subtlety and diplomacy are key. Aggressive behavior may result
in assassination attempts or blackmail.
Eldwyn Vale expects decorum: shouting or breaking decorum in the Hall of
Accord can void treaties or start political disputes.
In Aerion, respecting the Sky Mother and the rituals of the Windspire Academy is
essential. Even small disrespect can lead to ostracization.

Lodging & Provisions
•
•
•

Most cities have inns for all budgets, but some are seasonal (like the Winter
Market of Zimograd).
Outside urban centers, travelers must prepare for food scarcity, magical
hazards, and extreme climates.
Herbal remedies, elemental wards, and weather-resistant gear are highly
recommended.

Communication & Magic
•
•
•

Sending stones, airship messengers, and magical signal spells exist, but require
approval in some nations.
Rune-based or Shard-infused messages are regulated and often monitored for
espionage.
Learning local languages, magical dialects, or sigils increases survival chances
dramatically.

Adventurer Reputation & Guilds
•
•
•

Joining local guilds (mercenary, merchant, scholar, or magic-focused) can
unlock contracts, resources, and safe passage.
Fame spreads quickly in Vaeloran. Actions may open opportunities or invite rival
adventurers.
Mercenary guilds often operate under local or shard-based law. Ignoring
regulations can result in expulsion or bounty.

Races (Homebrew)
Aelvar
Marked by violet-hued skin and luminous sigils that trace naturally across their bodies,
the Aelvar carry the quiet presence of the unseen. Their features are refined and serene,
eyes often pale or shimmering with inner light. The markings upon their skin are not
tattoos or scars, but living patterns that subtly shift over time, reflecting emotional and
spiritual states.
Aelvar society values reflection, balance, and the careful stewardship of life and
memory. Many become healers, spiritual guides, or scholars of metaphysical forces. To
outsiders, they often appear distant or enigmatic, yet few question their integrity or
composure. Their long lifespans grant them patience, but also a tendency toward
cautious deliberation rather than impulsive action.
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (6-7 feet tall)
Life Expectancy: 250 years
Speed: 30 ft.
Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Aelvaric.
Veil Step. Opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.
Soulward Claim. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or
charmed.
Trace of the Veil. You can see openings within the veil of souls. If you are close to one
of these rifts, you can open a portal to the Spirit Realm. In addition, you can sense the
presence of undead, spirits, or lingering magical auras within 30 feet (no precise
location). You gain proficiency in Insight or Religion.
Echo Step. As a bonus action, you can shift partially into the Spirit Veil, teleporting up
to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see without provoking opportunity attacks.
You leave behind a faint echo of yourself that lingers for 3 rounds. As a bonus action on
your next turns, you can return to that echo’s location, ending the ability. You can only
do so if there isn’t anything obstructing the echo. Once you use this feature, you can’t
use it again until you finish a long rest.

Dravari
Scaled and powerful, the Dravari bear the unmistakable traits of ancient draconic
lineage. Horned crests, tails, clawed hands, and elongated snouts give them an
imposing silhouette, while their scales shimmer in a wide array of colors and metallic
sheens. Their eyes gleam with sharp intelligence and instinctive awareness.
Dravari culture prizes honor, discipline, and mastery over both body and environment.
Many dedicate themselves to martial training, aerial riding, scouting, or elemental
traditions passed down through clan lines. Though often perceived as intimidating,
Dravari place great importance on loyalty, personal responsibility, and earned respect.
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (5-6 feet tall)
Life Expectancy: 150 years
Speed: 30 ft.
Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Dravaric.
Draconic Presence. You can add your Constitution modifiers to Intimidation and
Persuasion ability checks.
Draconic Ancestry. Choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You
have resistance to that damage type.
Elemental Strike. Once per turn, when you hit a weapon attack or a cantrip, you can
deal additional 1d6 damage of your chosen ancestry type.
Elemental Burst. As an action, you exhale a 15-foot cone or 30-foot line of energy
matching your ancestry. Creatures hit make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 +
proficiency bonus + Constitution modifier), taking 2d8 and be pushed 10 ft on a failed
save or half that damage on a successful one. The damage this feature deals increases
by 1d8 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a long rest.

Durakken
Short in stature but dense in build, Durakken possess broad frames, powerful limbs,
and skin tones reminiscent of stone and metal. Their hands are calloused from a
lifetime of shaping, carving, and forging. Thick hair and beards are worn with pride,
often braided or adorned with crafted ornaments.
Durakken culture revolves around construction, engineering, and the pursuit of lasting
works. They believe every structure should endure beyond its maker, serving future
generations as proof of discipline and intent. Status among the Durakken is earned
through craftsmanship rather than lineage, and many travel far in search of rare
materials, forgotten techniques, or monumental commissions.
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (4-5 feet tall)
Life Expectancy: 300 years
Speed: 25 ft.
Language: You can speak, read, and write Common and Durakkic.
Master Builder. You gain proficiency with one artisan’s tool of your choice. You also
gain proficiency in Athletics or Investigation (your choice). When using tools to build,
reinforce, or repair structures, you work at double the normal speed, and you have
advantage on checks to assess structural integrity, weak points, or load limits.
Stoneborn Endurance. You have resistance to Poison and advantage on saving throws
you make to avoid or end the Poisoned condition. If you were to take damage from
falling debris or structures, you can reduce it by half.
Durakken Toughness. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1
again each time you gain a level. Additionally, when you roll Hit Dice to regain hit points
during a short rest, you may add +1 to each die rolled.
Heart of Granite. As a bonus action, you may anchor yourself like living stone. You gain
2d8 temporary hit points for 1 minute. While you have temporary hit points, you have
resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In
addition, you cannot be knocked prone or pushed unless you choose to be. The
temporary hit points this feature gives increases by 1d8 at 5th level, 11 th level and 17th
level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Eldari
Small and quick-moving, Eldari are easily recognized by the veil of physical darkness
that permanently shrouds their bodies. This shadow is not merely the absence of light,
but a tangible, magical obscurity through which only their oversized, luminous eyes can
be clearly seen. Subtle shifts in the darkness mirror their expressions and mood,
lending them an uncanny yet expressive presence.
Eldari are natural innovators and compulsive tinkerers, drawn toward mechanisms,
arcane devices, and experimental craft. Their cultures prize curiosity, cleverness, and
iterative creation over tradition or hierarchy, and failure is widely viewed as an essential
step toward discovery. Though often underestimated due to their small stature, Eldari
have shaped trade, technology, and magical infrastructure far beyond what their
numbers would suggest.
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Small (2-3 feet tall)
Life Expectancy: 100 years
Speed: 25 ft.
Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Eldaric.
Eldari’s knowledge. You gain proficiency with one tinker’s tool of your choice. When
you are analyzing a potion, a technological and magical objects, you may add your
Proficiency bonus to your roll.
Small and Agile. You can move through spaces occupied by creatures larger than you.
Umbral Veil. You gain a +1 bonus to AC against spell attacks. You gain an extra +1
against spell saving throws.
Shadow Distortion. As a bonus action, you destabilize the shadow surrounding your
body, warping perception and light for 1 minute. You become lightly obscured to other
creatures. Whenever a creature misses you with an attack or you succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw, you may immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking
opportunity attacks. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack or spell, you
may impose disadvantage on the next attack roll that creature makes before the start of
your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long
rest.

Erekar
Tall, angular, and unmistakably inhuman, the Erekar possess elongated limbs and
narrow proportions that give them an unsettling silhouette. Their skin often appears
chitinous, shadow-dark, or faintly luminous with internal sigils. Facial features are
minimal, dominated by piercing eyes that glow softly in low light.
Long associated with shadowed dealings, mercenary contracts, and high-risk
negotiations, the Erekar have cultivated a reputation for precision, efficiency, and
emotional detachment. In recent generations, many have begun redefining themselves
beyond their historic roles, seeking stable communities and personal identities.
Despite these changes, mistrust toward Erekar remains common in many regions.
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Large (7 to 8 feet tall)
Life Expectancy: Unknown (functionally ageless)
Speed: 30 ft.
Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Erekaric.
Darkvision. You have Darkvision with range of 60 feet.

temperament, social role, and the way their innate powers express themselves.

Gravahlren
Towering over most other peoples, the Gravahlren are immense humanoids with
powerful builds and mineral-toned skin. Subtle ridges, crystalline flecks, or stone-like
patterns may appear across their bodies, giving them the impression of living
monoliths. Their voices are deep and resonant, carrying easily across open spaces.
Gravahlren culture values endurance, strength of will, and communal bonds. They
often excel in heavy labor, construction, defense, and exploration of harsh
environments, especially frozen and mountainous regions. Generations spent enduring
brutal cold, thin air, and shifting terrain have hardened both their bodies and their
resolve. Though physically imposing, many Gravahlren are known for hearty laughter,
strong hospitality, and fierce loyalty to kin and companions.
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (7 to 9 feet tall)
Life Expectancy: 170 years

the weight you can push, drag, or lift, and for the purposes of grappling and being
grappled. You also have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to shove,
climb, or break objects. You have advantage on grappling.
Born from Ice. You have resistance to cold damage, and you automatically succeed on

minutes, and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist
exhaustion caused by environmental effects.

is increased by 1d10 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you
can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Halvyr
Winged humanoids adorned with radiant golden markings, the Halvyr possess an
unmistakable air of grace and presence. Their feathered wings span wide, capable of
sustained flight, while their luminous sigils glow faintly along the skin. Hair and eye
colors often reflect warm or celestial tones.
Halvyr traditions emphasize responsibility, discipline, and guardianship. Many serve as
messengers, sentinels, scholars, or keepers of ancient oaths. While admired for their
elegance and reliability, some Halvyr struggle with the weight of expectation placed
upon them by others who view them as symbols rather than individuals.
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (6 to 7 feet tall)
Life Expectancy: 170 years
Speed: 30 ft
Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Halvyric.

Lightbringer. You have resistance against Radiant damage. You can cast the light
cantrip.

addition, when an ally within 10 feet of you fails a saving throw against being frightened,
they may reroll it and must use the new roll.
Radiant Surge. As an action, you release the dormant light within your sigils, making an
opponent within 30 ft make a Dexterity saving throw (8 + proficiency bonus + your
mental modifier of choice) or take 2d8 radiant damage, or half as much on a failed save.
If the target took damage, you can make yourself or an ally within 10 feet gain hit points
equal to half the damage taken. The damage this feature deals is increased by 1d8 at
5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a long rest.

Hyran
Found throughout nearly every region of the world, Hyran are as varied as they are
numerous. They display immense diversity in appearance, belief, and culture, adapting
readily to new environments and social structures.
Hyran ambition and flexibility have made them influential in trade, diplomacy,

Realms
Mortal Realm
The physical world where most adventures take place. Time flows normally, matter is
stable, and life is bound by birth and death. All other realms influence the Mortal Realm
indirectly, but none replace it as the primary stage of existence.

Divine Realm
The domain of gods, demigods, and divine concepts. Reality here is shaped by belief,
authority, and cosmic law rather than physical rules.

Spirit Realm
A transitory realm tied to life, death, and natural cycles. Mortal souls pass through the
Spirit Realm after death before reincarnation, judgment, or dissolution.

Darkness Realm
A realm of entropy, decay, and erasure. Unlike the Spirit Realm, souls consumed here
are lost, not recycled. This is where daemons and void entities live.

Dream Realm
A mutable realm shaped by thought, emotion, and imagination. It overlaps both the
Mortal and Spirit Realms during sleep, visions, and altered states. Source of dreams,
nightmares, and prophecy.

Fey Realm
A distorted reflection of the Mortal Realm where nature, emotion, and instinct
dominate. Time flows unpredictably, and reality responds to intent and ritual. Home of
fey, tricksters, and ancient nature beings.

Astral Realm
The vast expanse between realms. It is not a destination but a medium through which
planar travel occurs. Used for teleportation and planar transit.

stated.

beyond the weapon’s normal range until the end of the current turn.
Reload. This weapon can be used to make a number of attacks before it must be
reloaded. If you are proficient with the weapon, reloading it takes an action or a Bonus
Action; otherwise, reloading it takes an action.

attacks instead. These attacks are always made with Disadvantage, regardless of
circumstance. You can’t replace these attacks. If this weapon has the Ammunition
property, these attacks use twice the normal amount of ammunition.
Explode. When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an
explosion from this weapon’s projectile. This explosion is a 5-foot-radius Sphere
centered on a point you choose within the weapon’s normal range. Each creature within
the Sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity
modifier and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes the weapon’s
damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. You can create
an explosion only once per turn.

attack rolls with this weapon. It grants advantage instead.
