## Weapon Properties

### Firearm
You don't add your ability modifier to the weapon's attack, unless otherwise stated.

### Recoil
After you make an attack with this weapon, you can't make ranged attacks beyond the weapon's normal range until the end of the current turn.

### Reload
This weapon can be used to make a number of attacks before it must be reloaded. If you are proficient with the weapon, reloading it takes an action or a Bonus Action; otherwise, reloading it takes an action.

## Weapon Masteries

### Automatic
When you make an attack with this weapon, you can choose to make two attacks instead. These attacks are always made with Disadvantage, regardless of circumstance. You can't replace these attacks. If this weapon has the Ammunition property, these attacks use twice the normal amount of ammunition.

### Explode
When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an explosion from this weapon's projectile. This explosion is a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within the weapon's normal range. Each creature within the Sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes the weapon's damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. You can create an explosion only once per turn.

### Scatter
Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with this weapon. It grants advantage instead.

### Sighted
Attacking at long range with this weapon doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls. When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon at long range, you can reroll any of the damage dice and must use the new roll.
