# Updated Weapons

Changes to existing D&D weapons for The Grand Divide campaign.

## Whip (Updated)

| Name | Damage | Properties | Mastery | Weight | Cost |
|------|--------|------------|---------|--------|------|
| Whip | 2d4 Piercing | Finesse, Reach | Slow | 3 lb. | 2 gp |

The whip has been updated to deal 2d4 piercing damage instead of 1d4 slashing, making it a more viable combat option while maintaining its unique reach property.
