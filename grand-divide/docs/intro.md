# The Grand Divide

Welcome to **The Grand Divide**, a D&D adventure set in the rich and diverse world of Vaeloran.

## About This World

The world of Vaeloran is a realm shaped by powerful Elemental Shards, ancient conflicts, and the resilience of its many peoples. From the floating islands of Aerion Skydrift to the depths of Aquaris, from the eternal darkness of the Umbra Court to the radiant splendor of Lumineth Sanctum, each nation bears the marks of history and the influence of elemental forces.
