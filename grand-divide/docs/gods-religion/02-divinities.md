# The Divinities

Gods below the creators who are tasked to control their domains.

## Nyssara, the Final Quiet
**Goddess of Finality - Aelvar**

Nyssara governs endings without cruelty or mercy. Death, closure, and completion fall under her gaze. She ensures that what must end does so cleanly, allowing the soul to move onward without echo or regret.

## Veridan, the Returning Bloom
**God of Renewal – Sylvari**

Veridan presides over rebirth, restoration, and the turning of cycles. Where something has ended, he ensures something new may rise — not the same, but renewed. His patience made divine.

## Kaelor, the Full Measure
**God of Abundance – Therian**

Kaelor embodies surplus, plenty, and thriving life. He does not create growth, but rewards harmony and balance with overflowing bounty. To take more than one's share is to fall from his favor.

## Varkuun, the Iron Trial
**God of Strife – Korveth**

Varkuun rules conflict, struggle, and opposition. He believes growth is forged only through resistance. War, rivalry, and adversity are his proving grounds — not for destruction, but for refinement.

## Lirienne, the Farbound
**Goddess of Travels – Nerai**

Lirienne watches over journeys, passages, and movement between places. Roads, currents, winds, and safe crossings fall under her care. Every traveler unknowingly walks within her sight.

## Marthisa, the Golden Accord
**Goddess of Commerce – Hyran**

Marthisia governs trade, exchange, and agreement. Coin, contracts, and negotiation are her tools. Prosperity comes not from greed, but from fair and willing exchange.

## Brannok, the Joyous Roar
**God of Festivities – Gravahlren**

Brannok celebrates laughter, feasts, song, and shared revelry. He reminds mortals that joy itself is sacred, and that unity is forged not only in hardship, but in celebration.

## Saelyth, the Veiled Mind
**Goddess of Knowledge – Vaelari**

Saelyth is the keeper of truth, memory, and understanding. Knowledge is neither good nor evil to her — only preserved. Secrets are hers to guard, not to judge.

## Dhoram, the First Hand
**God of Arts – Durakken**

Dhoram shaped beauty from intention. Art, architecture, design, and creation flow through his domain. He teaches that meaning is carved, painted, sung, or forged into existence.

## Halcion, the Unbroken Line
**God of Order – Halvyr**

Halcion governs law, structure, hierarchy, and balance. He does not punish — he corrects. To him, order is not oppression, but clarity given form.

## Eryndra, the Burning Pulse
**Goddess of Passion – Erekar**

Eryndra embodies intensity: love, rage, devotion, ambition, and desire. She teaches that passion is neither virtue nor vice — it is the force that drives all action.

## Somnyr, the Sleepless Star
**Goddess of Dreams – Dravari**

Somnyr reigns over dreams, visions, and the realm of the sleeping mind. She speaks in symbols and omens, guiding souls through the quiet spaces between thought and reality.
