# The Creators

They who have created everything.

## Aionyx, the Still Axis

The unmoving point around which all moments turn. Aionyx does not rule the future or the past — he halts them. In his presence, all things are fixed, observed, and weighed. It is said that history exists only because Aionyx allows it to resume.

## Vaelthra, the Infinite Womb

The first expanse and the final horizon. Vaelthra shaped distance, direction, and possibility, allowing existence to separate from itself. Every realm, plane, and world rests within the vastness she continuously unfolds.
