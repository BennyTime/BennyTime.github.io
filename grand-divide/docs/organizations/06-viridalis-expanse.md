# Viridalis Expanse

The vast forest realm ruled by druids and guardians of natural balance.

## Verdant Circle

Druidic guardians of the inner forest and the Nature Shard. They control access to the Verdant Sanctum and enforce the forest's balance. Those who violate their laws are rarely seen again.

**Circle Voice:** Elder Thalyss Gwreiddyn (Sylvari)

The Verdant Circle wields absolute authority within the deep forest. They determine who may enter the inner sanctum, regulate resource extraction, and punish those who threaten the natural order. Their judgment is final and often fatal.

## Harvestbound League

An agricultural coordination body managing food production and exports across Vaeloran.

**League Steward:** Marcen Olivarre (Therian)

The League coordinates Viridalis's agricultural output, ensuring sustainable farming practices while supplying food to nations across the continent. Their influence extends far beyond the forest through trade agreements and harvest contracts.

## Whispering Wardens

Forest rangers maintaining the boundary between the outer plains and the inner sanctum.

**Lead Warden:** Ssaelwyn (Sylvari)

The Wardens patrol the boundary zones, guiding travelers, monitoring threats, and enforcing the Verdant Circle's decrees. They serve as the first line of defense against those who would exploit or harm the deep forest.
