# Aetherflux Dominion

The technological and arcane powerhouse of Vaeloran, governed by guild councils and innovation.

## Dynamo Consortium

The largest merchant and logistics guild in Aetherflux, specializing in aethertech, constructs, and lightning-powered infrastructure. They control major export routes and storm-safe transport systems.

**Director:** Veyron Kalixis (Eldari)

The Consortium dominates Aetherflux's economy, managing everything from lightning-powered rail systems to construct manufacturing. Their influence extends beyond the Dominion through trade agreements and technological exports.

## Guild-Council of Sparks

The ruling body of Aetherflux, formed from leaders of major guilds, research circles, and industrial unions.

**Prime Spark:** Nyxa Volaris (Eldari)

Rather than a traditional monarchy, Aetherflux is governed by this council of guild masters and scholars. Decisions are made through debate, voting, and occasionally, demonstrations of technological superiority.

## Aetherflux Academy Circles

Internal factions within the Academy divided by ideology: pure arcane theory, pure scientific method, or hybrid disciplines. Rivalry is intense but often seen as a motivator for greatness.

**High Chancellor:** Dr. Selior Thanesci (Eldari)

The Academy's internal divisions drive innovation through competition. Each circle pursues its own approach to understanding reality, leading to rapid advancement—and occasional disasters.
