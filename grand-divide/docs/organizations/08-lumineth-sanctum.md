# Lumineth Sanctum

The theocratic nation where divine law, religious authority, and temporal power are unified.

## Church of the Eternal Radiance

The theocratic authority governing the Sanctum. Faith, law, and divine judgment are inseparable here. Doctrinal dissent is not tolerated.

**High Luminary:** Pontifex Aurellius (Halvyr)

The Church wields absolute authority in Lumineth, combining religious leadership with governmental power. All laws derive from religious doctrine, and all citizens are expected to demonstrate unwavering faith.

## Seraphic Inquisition

Investigators of heresy, corruption, and forbidden practices. Their verdicts are final and universally feared.

**Inquisitor Prime:** Seris Luxar (Hyran)

The Inquisition hunts down those who deviate from Church doctrine, practice forbidden magic, or consort with darkness. Their methods are ruthless, their judgment absolute, and their reach extends beyond Lumineth's borders through international agreements.

## Auric Forge Conclave

Smith-priests responsible for forging Luxmetal relics and arms.

**Forge-Saint:** Matraeus Goldhan (Hyran)

The Conclave creates weapons and armor from Luxmetal, a material touched by the Light Shard's radiance. These sacred arms are wielded by the Church's champions and distributed to those deemed worthy by divine mandate.
