# Thundarkar Range

Master architects responsible for Vaeloran's most enduring structures.

**Conclave Voice:** Bromdir Steinruf (Durakken)

The Conclave designs fortresses, bridges, and monuments that stand for centuries. Their expertise is sought by every nation, and structures bearing the Conclave's seal are considered impregnable.

## Deep Delvers Union

Explorers of ancient ruins, caverns, and buried megastructures. Recover lost stonecraft techniques and forgotten designs.

**Union Foreman:** Kelda Riftbreaker (Gravahlren)

The Delvers venture into Vaeloran's deepest places, uncovering pre-Shard War ruins and lost technologies. Their discoveries often reshape understanding of ancient history—and occasionally unleash dangers best left buried.

## Litharium Oathbound

Spiritual and legal keepers of stone-carved oaths. Breaking an oath recorded here carries continent-wide consequences.

**Oathwarden:** Thrain Felsberg (Durakken)

When an oath is carved into stone by the Oathbound, it becomes more than a promise—it becomes a binding contract enforced by tradition, law, and sometimes supernatural consequence. Violating such an oath results in exile from all civilized lands.
