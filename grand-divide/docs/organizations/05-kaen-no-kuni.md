# Kaen no Kuni

The martial empire of fire and honor, where warrior clans uphold ancient codes.

## Ember Clans

A coalition of Korveth-led warrior clans bound by honor codes and fire rites. They supply elite soldiers, generals, and military advisors across Vaeloran. Breaking an Ember oath carries lifelong consequences.

**High Clanlord:** Katsuro Enjin (Korveth)

The Ember Clans represent the pinnacle of martial tradition in Vaeloran. Their warriors are sought after as mercenaries, bodyguards, and military commanders. An Ember oath is considered unbreakable—violating one results in permanent exile and dishonor.

## Obsidian Artisans

Master smiths responsible for forging shard-adjacent weapons and armor. Weapons are often engraved with the maker's name as a mark of accountability.

**Forge Master:** Emira Ashkar (Dravari)

The Artisans create some of the finest weapons in Vaeloran, including firearms and blades enhanced through proximity to the Fire Shard. Each weapon bears its maker's mark, binding the smith's honor to the quality of their work.

## Temple of Ember Orders

Monastic orders overseeing the spiritual and ritual aspects of the Fire Shard.

**Flame Abbot:** Ryoshin Kagen (Korveth)

The Temple maintains the spiritual connection between Kaen no Kuni and the Fire Shard, conducting rituals, training fire monks, and interpreting the will of flame. They also mediate disputes involving sacred oaths and honor codes.
