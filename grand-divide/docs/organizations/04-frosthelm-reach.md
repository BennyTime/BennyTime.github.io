# Frosthelm Reach

The frozen northern territories governed by clan councils and warrior traditions.

## Northern Clans Assembly

A council of elders representing Frosthelm's major clans. Once a decision is made, it is followed without exception.

**Speaker:** Ylva Ísdrótt (Gravahlren)

The Assembly operates through consensus among clan elders, but once consensus is reached, all clans are bound to obey. This system ensures unity in the harsh northern environment where division means death.

## White Fang Lodges

Hunter lodges specializing in dangerous beasts, spirits, and extreme environments. Often hired as guides or monster-slayers.

**Packmaster:** Rurik Snjófang (Gravahlren)

The White Fang Lodges train the finest hunters and trackers in Vaeloran. Their expertise in surviving—and hunting—the frozen wastes makes them invaluable to expeditions into Frosthelm's deadliest regions.

## Winterbound Wardens

Guardians of Frosthelm's borders, mountain passes, and Ice Shard disturbances. They are often the first to detect threats in the north.

**Warden-Captain:** Svala Korgrym (Dravari)

The Wardens patrol the boundaries between civilization and the frozen wilderness, watching for aberrations spawned by the Ice Shard, foreign incursions, and supernatural threats emerging from the eternal ice.
