# The Umbra Court

The shadow nation ruled by five great noble houses, each controlling different aspects of darkness.

## The Five Great Houses of Umbra

The true power of the Umbra Court lies in its noble houses, each controlling a different aspect of shadow society:

### House Noctavera
**Specialty:** Illusions and shadow communication  
**Matron:** Velisse Noctavera (Vanyr)

Masters of deception and covert messaging, House Noctavera controls the Court's intelligence networks and diplomatic illusions. Their agents move unseen through Vaeloran's courts, gathering secrets and spreading carefully crafted misinformation.

### House Draegoth
**Specialty:** Warfare and enforcement  
**Warlord:** Kaerix Draegoth (Erekar)

The military might of the Umbra Court, House Draegoth commands shadow-trained warriors and enforces the Court's will. Their soldiers strike from darkness, leaving no witnesses and few survivors.

### House Valcienne
**Specialty:** Clandestine trade and luxury  
**Patron:** Lucien Valcienne (Eldari)

Merchants of shadow-touched goods, forbidden luxuries, and information. House Valcienne operates trade networks that exist in legal gray areas, dealing in everything from rare artifacts to blackmail material.

### House Mor'Khal
**Specialty:** Archives and shadow-priesthood  
**High Curator:** Zareth Mor'Khal (Aelvar)

Keepers of the Court's historical records and shadow rituals. House Mor'Khal maintains the spiritual connection to the Darkness Shard and preserves knowledge that other houses would prefer forgotten.

### House Sanguir
**Specialty:** Ancient bloodlines and shard ties  
**Lord Eternal:** Vaelor Sanguir (Vaelari)

The oldest and most mysterious house, claiming direct descent from those who first bound the Darkness Shard. House Sanguir wields influence through tradition, ancient pacts, and bloodline magic that defies modern understanding.
