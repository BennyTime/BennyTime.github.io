# Therian

Therians possess the blended features of humanoids and beasts, ranging widely in appearance depending on lineage. Some resemble furred or feathered humanoids, while others retain more pronounced animal traits such as muzzles, tails, claws, or digitigrade legs.

## Society & Culture

Their cultures vary dramatically between clans and regions, often shaped by instinctive traditions, pack structures, and environmental adaptation. Many Therian societies value kinship, territory, and practical survival skills. Their diversity makes generalizations unreliable.

## Racial Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid  
**Size**: Small or Medium (3 to 8 feet tall)  
**Life Expectancy**: 80 years  
**Speed**: 30 ft.  
**Languages**: You can speak, read, and write Common and Theronian.

### Physical Build
When creating your character, you may choose one of the following frames:

- **Light Frame** – You can move through spaces occupied by creatures one size larger than you, and squeezing through tight terrain does not cost extra movement. You have advantage on Acrobatics checks.
- **Balanced Frame** – You gain proficiency with either Athletics or Acrobatics. When you make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, you can add +1 to the roll.
- **Powerful Frame** – You count as one size larger for carrying capacity, and the weight you can push, drag or lift. You have advantage on Athletics checks.
- **Massive Frame** – Your walking speed is reduced by 5. You have advantage on saving throws made to resist being knocked prone or pushed. You count as one size larger for carrying capacity and resisting forced movement.

### Adaptive Physiology
Rather than fixed racial abilities, Therians customize their physical and instinctual traits. When you create your character, choose 4 additional passive traits from the Therian Trait List. Once chosen, these traits cannot be changed. You cannot select the same trait more than once. All Therian traits are passive features and require no actions.
