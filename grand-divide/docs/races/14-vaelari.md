# Vaelari

Composed partially or wholly of elemental matter, Vaelari appear as humanoid forms shaped from stone, flame, mist, water, lightning, metal, or other primal substances. Some possess nearly solid bodies, while others appear semi-ethereal or constantly shifting.

## Society & Culture

Vaelari are naturally attuned to volatile energies and often serve as stabilizers, scholars, and guardians of dangerous phenomena. Emotional states can subtly influence their elemental expression, making self-discipline an important cultural value.

**Life Expectancy**: 200 years

### Innate Conduit
You gain proficiency in Arcana. You can use a spellcasting focus even if your hands are full.

### Elemental Stability
You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.

### Flow Attunement
Once per turn, when you deal damage with a spell, you can change that damage to force damage. If the spell already deals force damage, it deals +1 additional damage times the original level of the spell used.

### Mana Suppression Zone
As an action, you release unstable mana into a 15 ft radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 60 ft. For one minute, creatures of your choice inside the area suffer a 1d4 penalty to saving throws. Whenever a creature fails an Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw related to your spells, you can use your reaction to make it take 1d8 psychic damage. The damage this feature deals is increased by 1d8 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
