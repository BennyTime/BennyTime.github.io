# Plasari

Naturally amorphous, Plasari exist as semi-translucent masses of shifting substance capable of forming humanoid shapes. Their coloration and texture fluctuate subtly even at rest, and their features remain slightly fluid rather than rigidly fixed.

## Society & Culture

Plasari possess remarkable adaptability and an unusual resistance to environmental extremes. They often live discreetly among other peoples, adopting stable forms to blend into local societies. Their communities are loose, memory-driven, and highly individualistic, valuing experience and survival above rigid tradition.

## Racial Traits

**Creature Type**: Ooze  
**Size**: Medium (4 to 6 feet tall in typical humanoid form)  
**Life Expectancy**: 500 years (though age is meaningless; they slowly lose cohesion instead of dying)  
**Speed**: 30 ft.  
**Languages**: You can speak, read, and write Common and Plasaric.

### Adaptive Morphology
You can alter your skin tone, facial structure, hair, and minor physical features at will. These changes are cosmetic and do not affect your statistics. You have advantage on Deception checks made to pass yourself off as a member of another humanoid ancestry.

### Amorphous Body
You can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing penalties, provided you are wearing and carrying nothing, and you have advantage on checks and saving throws against being grappled or restrained. You also do not need to eat or breathe, though you can mimic those functions.

### Reform
Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage from a weapon and you don't drop to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus, up to the amount of damage taken.

### Perfect Imitation
As an action, you can fully reshape your body to perfectly imitate another Medium or Small humanoid you have seen, including voice, coloration, scent and physical mannerisms. Your equipment does not change. A creature can attempt an Investigation check against your Deception to see through the disguise after interacting with you for at least 1 minute. You may maintain this form for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. You may use this feature a number of times equal to half of your proficiency modifier (rounded down) and regain all usages on a long rest.
