# Korveth

Broad-shouldered and muscular, the Korveth possess prominent tusks, heavy brows, and powerful builds. Their skin tones range through greens, greys, and earth hues, often bearing scars that mark past trials and victories.

## Society & Culture

Korveth culture emphasizes honor, martial discipline, and personal accountability. Many follow strict codes of conduct passed through clan traditions. Though often stereotyped as aggressive or blunt, Korveth communities place deep importance on loyalty, respect, and earned trust.

## Racial Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid  
**Size**: Medium (6–7½ feet tall)  
**Life Expectancy**: 120 years  
**Speed**: 30 ft.  
**Languages**: You can speak, read, and write Common and Korvethi.

### Marked Deeds
You gain proficiency in History. You can perfectly recall the names, faces, and actions of any creature you have meaningfully interacted with in the past month. In addition, you have advantage on checks made to recall or verify reputations, past conflicts, bloodlines, or notable deeds.

### Military Training
You gain proficiency with light armor. If you are already proficient with light armor, you gain proficiency with medium armor instead. If you are already proficient with medium armor, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. If you are already proficient with heavy armor, you gain +1 AC while wearing armor. When wearing armor, you can still benefit from features that require you to be unarmored.

### Punishing Follow-Through
Once per turn when you hit a creature that has already taken damage since the end of your last turn, you deal extra damage equal to your Proficiency bonus. The damage type is the same as the weapon or spell used.

### Battle Warcry
As a bonus action, you let out a thunderous warcry that steels allies and terrifies foes. You and allies who hear you within 20 ft gain advantage on their next turn. In addition, for the rest of combat, they also gain advantage against being frightened. Enemies within 20ft of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Charisma modifier) or have disadvantage on their next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
