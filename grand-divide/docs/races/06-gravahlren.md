# Gravahlren

Towering over most other peoples, the Gravahlren are immense humanoids with powerful builds and mineral-toned skin. Subtle ridges, crystalline flecks, or stone-like patterns may appear across their bodies, giving them the impression of living monoliths. Their voices are deep and resonant, carrying easily across open spaces.

## Society & Culture

Gravahlren culture values endurance, strength of will, and communal bonds. They often excel in heavy labor, construction, defense, and exploration of harsh environments, especially frozen and mountainous regions. Generations spent enduring brutal cold, thin air, and shifting terrain have hardened both their bodies and their resolve. Though physically imposing, many Gravahlren are known for hearty laughter, strong hospitality, and fierce loyalty to kin and companions.
