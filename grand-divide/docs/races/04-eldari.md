# Eldari

Small and quick-moving, Eldari are easily recognized by the veil of physical darkness that permanently shrouds their bodies. This shadow is not merely the absence of light, but a tangible, magical obscurity through which only their oversized, luminous eyes can be clearly seen. Subtle shifts in the darkness mirror their expressions and mood, lending them an uncanny yet expressive presence.

## Society & Culture

Eldari are natural innovators and compulsive tinkerers, drawn toward mechanisms, arcane devices, and experimental craft. Their cultures prize curiosity, cleverness, and iterative creation over tradition or hierarchy, and failure is widely viewed as an essential step toward discovery. Though often underestimated due to their small stature, Eldari have shaped trade, technology, and magical infrastructure far beyond what their numbers would suggest.

As a bonus action, you destabilize the shadow surrounding your body, warping perception and light for 1 minute. You become lightly obscured to other creatures. Whenever a creature misses you with an attack or you succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, you may immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack or spell, you may impose disadvantage on the next attack roll that creature makes before the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
