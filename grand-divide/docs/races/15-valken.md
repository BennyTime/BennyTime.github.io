# Valken

Artificial beings crafted from metal, porcelain, or composite materials, Valken display visible joints, segmented limbs, and glowing cores or lenses. Their faces often resemble masks or carved expressions rather than organic features.

## Society & Culture

Once regarded as tools and labor constructs, Valken now seek identity, autonomy, and social recognition. Many struggle with lingering legal restrictions and societal suspicion while forging personal purpose beyond their original design.

## Racial Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid  
**Size**: Medium (6-7 feet tall)  
**Life Expectancy**: Indefinite  
**Speed**: 30 feet  
**Languages**: You can speak, read, and write Common and Valkenico.

### Construct Physiology
You do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours, during which you remain conscious but motionless. You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you are immune to disease.

### Integrated Plating
As a Valken, you cannot wear armor. Instead, when you create your character, you may choose a type of hull.

| Type | Base AC | Prerequisite | Bonus |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Ultra-Light | 10 + DEX | None | Your speed increases by 5 ft. You ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble, machinery or cramped spaces. If you'd fall at least 10 ft, you can reduce the falling damage by an amount equal to 5 x your level |
| Light | 11 + DEX | Light Armor Proficiency | You add 5 feet to your speed. When you take the Dash or Disengage action, you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn |
| Medium | 13 + DEX (Max 2) | Medium Armor Proficiency | You have advantage on saving throws against being grappled, restrained, or knocked prone |
| Heavy | 17 | Heavy Armor Proficiency | You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. When you are hit by a non-magical weapon attack, you reduce the damage by 1 (before resistances). You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift |

You may integrate armor to gain their magical effects. This would require 1 day of work. You may change your type of hull in a proper station. This would require 1 week of work.

### Arcane Incompatibility
Your artificial body cannot properly channel magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you take psychic damage equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way. You can still use magic items normally, even the abilities of them if they say so. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and gain resistance to psychic damage.

### Overclock
As a bonus action, you push your core beyond safe operating limits for 1 minute, increasing your speed by 10 ft. In addition, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d6 of that weapon's damage. You can Dash and Disengage as a bonus action. When Overclock ends, you immediately gain one level of exhaustion. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
