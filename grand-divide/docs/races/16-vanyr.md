# Vanyr

Pale-skinned and unnaturally graceful, the Vanyr possess elongated canines and eyes whose coloration reflects noble lineage. Their movements are precise and predatory, and their bodies maintain a faint chill even in warm climates.

## Society & Culture

Vanyr society is structured around powerful houses, bloodlines, and intricate political maneuvering. They command influence through wealth, secrecy, and long-term planning. Though often feared, their discipline and strategic insight grant them lasting relevance in many regions.

## Racial Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid  
**Size**: Medium (5 to 6 feet)  
**Life Expectancy**: Indefinite  
**Speed**: 30 feet  
**Languages**: You can speak, read, and write Common and Vanarian.

### Noble Precision
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack or spell, you may impose one of the following effects until the start of your next turn:

- The target has disadvantage on opportunity attacks.
- The target has disadvantage on Concentration checks.
- The target's speed is reduced by 10 ft.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

### Blood-Draw Focus
When you deal damage to a creature, you gain a Blood Focus (maximum 1). While you have Blood Focus, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and spell save DC. Blood Focus is lost if you miss an attack or a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your spell.

### Sunbound Curse
You have a strong adversity against sunlight. While in direct sunlight, you have disadvantage on attacks, Strength, Dexterity and Constitution checks and saving throws. If you aren't being affected by Sunbound Curse, you instead gain magical Darkvision with a range of 60ft.

### Blood Ascendance
As a bonus action, you awaken your lineage. For 1 minute, your speed increases by 10 ft. Once per turn, whenever you deal damage, you regain 1d10 hit points (if it would overheal you in any way, you gain that many temporary hit points instead). In addition, you ignore the Sunbound Curse's negative effects, and you may convert your damage to necrotic damage. When Blood Ascendance ends, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. The healing this feature gives is increased by 1d10 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
