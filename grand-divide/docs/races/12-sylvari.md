### Forest's Insight
You gain proficiency in Nature. You may do a Nature (Intelligence) skill check to ask the forest for their insight. You may ask the forest any information that it might know, for example: past events that happened there, people's location in that forest and even ask the forest which path to choose. The DC for this check will be different depending on the question asked, which is determined by the DM. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all usages after a long rest.

### Photosynthesis
When you do a short rest you can regain extra heath equal to 1d12 + your constitution modifier. You can't use this ability if don't have any sunlight.

### Barkskin Resilience
When you aren't wearing heavy armor, your AC is increased by 1. You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, paralyzed or to be put to sleep.

### Rampant Growth
As an action, you cause thick vines and living roots to erupt from the ground in up to 4 squares within 30 ft, making 10 ft tall walls. Each wall grants cover, has AC equal to 10 + proficiency bonus and have hitpoints equal to 2d6 + your proficiency. It's weak to fire and resistant against bludgeoning and piercing damage. The walls last for 1 minute or until destroyed. At level 5, 11 and 17, your wall gains an additional 2d6 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
