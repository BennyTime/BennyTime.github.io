# Dravari

Scaled and powerful, the Dravari bear the unmistakable traits of ancient draconic lineage. Horned crests, tails, clawed hands, and elongated snouts give them an imposing silhouette, while their scales shimmer in a wide array of colors and metallic sheens. Their eyes gleam with sharp intelligence and instinctive awareness.

## Society & Culture

Dravari culture prizes honor, discipline, and mastery over both body and environment. Many dedicate themselves to martial training, aerial riding, scouting, or elemental traditions passed down through clan lines. Though often perceived as intimidating, Dravari place great importance on loyalty, personal responsibility, and earned respect.

### Elemental Strike
Once per turn, when you hit with a weapon attack or a cantrip, you can deal additional 1d6 damage of your chosen ancestry type.

### Elemental Burst
As an action, you exhale a 15-foot cone or 30-foot line of energy matching your ancestry. Creatures hit make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Constitution modifier), taking 2d8 damage and being pushed 10 ft on a failed save or half that damage on a successful one. The damage this feature deals increases by 1d8 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
