# Erekar

Tall, angular, and unmistakably inhuman, the Erekar possess elongated limbs and narrow proportions that give them an unsettling silhouette. Their skin often appears chitinous, shadow-dark, or faintly luminous with internal sigils. Facial features are minimal, dominated by piercing eyes that glow softly in low light.

## Society & Culture

Long associated with shadowed dealings, mercenary contracts, and high-risk negotiations, the Erekar have cultivated a reputation for precision, efficiency, and emotional detachment. In recent generations, many have begun redefining themselves beyond their historic roles, seeking stable communities and personal identities. Despite these changes, mistrust toward Erekar remains common in many regions.

### Suit Mark
At birth, every Erekar manifests a Suit Mark – a sigil that influences temperament, social role, and the way their innate powers express themselves.

- **Clubs** - You count as one size larger for carrying capacity, push/drag/lift, and grappling. Your reach is increased by 5 feet.
- **Diamonds** - You gain proficiency in Investigation and one gaming set of your choice. You gain the ability to estimate the value of non-magical items.
- **Hearts** - You gain proficiency in Persuasion or Insight. When a creature you can see fails a saving throw against being charmed or frightened by you or an ally within 30 feet, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
- **Spades** - You can take the Hide or Disengage action as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per short rest. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in dim light or darkness.

### Contract-Bound Mind
You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or magically compelled to act against your will. You gain proficiency in one mental saving throw of your choice.

### Luck of the Draw
As a bonus action, you manifest a spectral deck of four sigils and draw fate into your body. Roll a d4 to determine the effect:

1. **Club** – For 1 minute, your next weapon attack deals an extra 2d6 damage and pushes the target 10 feet.
2. **Diamond** – You gain advantage on all attacks, saving throws and ability checks until the start of your next turn.
3. **Heart** - One creature you can see within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + PB + your chosen mental modifier) or be charmed by you.
4. **Spade** – You can teleport up to 30 ft to a space you can see. Gain advantage on your next attack roll.

The damage for the club's sigil is increased by 1d6 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
