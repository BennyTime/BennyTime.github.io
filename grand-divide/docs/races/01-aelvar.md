# Aelvar

Marked by violet-hued skin and luminous sigils that trace naturally across their bodies, the Aelvar carry the quiet presence of the unseen. Their features are refined and serene, eyes often pale or shimmering with inner light. The markings upon their skin are not tattoos or scars, but living patterns that subtly shift over time, reflecting emotional and spiritual states.

## Society & Culture

Aelvar society values reflection, balance, and the careful stewardship of life and memory. Many become healers, spiritual guides, or scholars of metaphysical forces. To outsiders, they often appear distant or enigmatic, yet few question their integrity or composure. Their long lifespans grant them patience, but also a tendency toward cautious deliberation rather than impulsive action.

### Veil Step
Opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.

### Soulward Claim
You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

### Trace of the Veil
You can see openings within the veil of souls. If you are close to one of these rifts, you can open a portal to the Spirit Realm. In addition, you can sense the presence of undead, spirits, or lingering magical auras within 30 feet (no precise location). You gain proficiency in Insight or Religion.

### Echo Step
As a bonus action, you can shift partially into the Spirit Veil, teleporting up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see without provoking opportunity attacks. You leave behind a faint echo of yourself that lingers for 3 rounds. As a bonus action on your next turns, you can return to that echo's location, ending the ability. You can only do so if there isn't anything obstructing the echo. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
