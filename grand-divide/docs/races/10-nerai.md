# Nerai

Amphibious humanoids with smooth, vibrant skin and feathery external gills, the Nerai possess a distinctly aquatic appearance. Webbed fingers, large expressive eyes, and subtle fin ridges aid their movement through water. Their coloration ranges from soft pastels to deep ocean hues.

## Society & Culture

Nerai societies are fluid and communal, shaped by ocean currents, tides, and long-distance navigation. They value adaptability, cooperation, and emotional intelligence. Many excel as sailors, traders, explorers, and diplomats between distant coastal cultures.

### Tideborn Navigator
You gain proficiency in Navigator's Tools and either Survival or Perception. You always know which way is true north while outdoors or at sea, and you have advantage on checks made to navigate, avoid becoming lost, predict tides or currents, or chart safe passages through water.

### Amphibious Physiology
You can breathe both in land and in water. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, don't suffer any kind of movement restrictions from difficult terrain formed by water, and you do not suffer penalties for fighting underwater with simple or martial melee weapons.

### Flowstrike
Once per turn, when you hit a creature while you moved at least 10 ft since the start of the turn, you deal extra damage equal to your Proficiency bonus. The damage type is the same as the weapon or spell used.

### Reef Barrier
As a bonus action, you create a 10ft radius shimmering sphere of water centered on yourself for 1 minute. While this barrier is active, you and allies within it take reduced damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus. In addition, allies can move through creatures' spaces as if they were difficult terrain, and this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The barrier ends early if you are incapacitated or leave the radius. The damage reduced this feature gives is increased by 1d4 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
