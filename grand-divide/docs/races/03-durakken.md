# Durakken

Short in stature but dense in build, Durakken possess broad frames, powerful limbs, and skin tones reminiscent of stone and metal. Their hands are calloused from a lifetime of shaping, carving, and forging. Thick hair and beards are worn with pride, often braided or adorned with crafted ornaments.

## Society & Culture

Durakken culture revolves around construction, engineering, and the pursuit of lasting works. They believe every structure should endure beyond its maker, serving future generations as proof of discipline and intent. Status among the Durakken is earned through craftsmanship rather than lineage, and many travel far in search of rare materials, forgotten techniques, or monumental commissions.

### Master Builder
You gain proficiency with one artisan's tool of your choice. You also gain proficiency in Athletics or Investigation (your choice). When using tools to build, reinforce, or repair structures, you work at double the normal speed, and you have advantage on checks to assess structural integrity, weak points, or load limits.

### Stoneborn Endurance
You have resistance to Poison and advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Poisoned condition. If you were to take damage from falling debris or structures, you can reduce it by half.

### Durakken Toughness
Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again each time you gain a level. Additionally, when you roll Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short rest, you may add +1 to each die rolled.

### Heart of Granite
As a bonus action, you may anchor yourself like living stone. You gain 2d8 temporary hit points for 1 minute, but your speed is reduced by 5 ft. While you have temporary hit points, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, you cannot be knocked prone or pushed unless you choose to be. The temporary hit points this feature gives increases by 1d8 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
