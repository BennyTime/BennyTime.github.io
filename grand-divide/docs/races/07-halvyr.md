# Halvyr

Winged humanoids adorned with radiant golden markings, the Halvyr possess an unmistakable air of grace and presence. Their feathered wings span wide, capable of sustained flight, while their luminous sigils glow faintly along the skin. Hair and eye colors often reflect warm or celestial tones.

## Society & Culture

Halvyr traditions emphasize responsibility, discipline, and guardianship. Many serve as messengers, sentinels, scholars, or keepers of ancient oaths. While admired for their elegance and reliability, some Halvyr struggle with the weight of expectation placed upon them by others who view them as symbols rather than individuals.

### Winged Flight
You have a flying speed equal to your walk speed. You can't use this flying speed while wearing medium or heavy armor or while carrying more than your carrying capacity.

### Lightbringer
You have resistance against Radiant damage. You can cast the light cantrip.

### Echo of the Fallen
You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. In addition, when an ally within 10 feet of you fails a saving throw against being frightened, they may reroll it and must use the new roll.

### Radiant Surge
As an action, you release the dormant light within your sigils, making an opponent within 30 ft make a Dexterity saving throw (8 + proficiency bonus + your mental modifier of choice) or take 2d8 radiant damage, or half as much on a failed save. If the target took damage, you can make yourself or an ally within 10 feet gain hit points equal to half the damage taken. The damage this feature deals is increased by 1d8 at 5th level, 11th level and 17th level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
