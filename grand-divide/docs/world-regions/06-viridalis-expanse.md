# Viridalis Expanse

**Elemental Shard**: Nature Shard  
**Real-World Parallel**: Outer Region - Rural Alentejo Portugal (1970s–80s); Inner Region - Mesoamerican ritual culture fused with ancient, sacred forest

## Geographic Overview

The Viridalis Expanse stretches across sun-warmed plains, cork forests, olive groves, vineyard-dotted hills, and winding rivers reminiscent of the rural Mediterranean. The outer lands are open, golden, and pastoral — home to quiet Therion villages and farmlands that supply much of Vaeloran's grain and produce.

But at the center lies an entirely different world.

Deep within the heart of the Expanse rises the **Verdant Sanctum**, a colossal, untouched primordial forest where ancient trees tower like natural cathedrals. Their canopies blot out the sky, and their roots form tunnels, bridges, and living halls. This inner region is the sacred domain of the Sylvari — guarded, mystical, and shaped directly by the Nature Shard's presence.

The two realms coexist in balance yet remain distinct: the humble rural frontier and the enchanted, ancient forest within.

## Role in the World

The Expanse is Vaeloran's agricultural heart, its fertile climate nourishing fields, orchards, and medicinal groves. The outer lands welcome trade, travelers, and scholars of herbal medicine.

The inner woods, however, are among the most protected places on the continent. The power of the Nature Shard makes the Verdant Sanctum a wellspring of living magic — influencing seasons, wildlife, and the vitality of soil across Vaeloran. Druids, spiritualists, and elemental scholars regard it as the closest thing to a living miracle.

The Expanse is often seen as Vaeloran's pulse: steady, grounding, and life-giving, yet capable of overwhelming force when its balance is threatened.

## Culture & Society

### Outer Region — The Therion Frontier

Life follows the rhythm of the sun. Communities are humble and hardworking, valuing family, agriculture, and craftsmanship. Taverns serve strong wines and hearty stews, musicians play rustic string instruments, and festivals celebrate harvests, rain, and ancestral spirits.

The people are known for warmth, hospitality, and a deep bond with the land. Tradition is strong, and superstition runs deep — especially warnings never to enter the inner forest without permission.

### Inner Region — The Sylvari Sanctum

The inner region is a sanctified ancient forest-kingdom where every leaf is sacred. Towering trees rise higher than any mortal-built structure, their branches forming interconnected pathways and spiraling sanctuaries. Sunlight barely reaches the ground, replaced by emerald twilight and glimmering flowers.

Here, the Sylvari maintain a ceremonial culture inspired by ancient Mesoamerican ritual practice — but shaped entirely through nature, not stone:

- Temples are living, spiraling root-structures
- Altars bloom from giant flowers or moss-covered roots
- Councils meet in canopy halls grown from braided branches

Stone exists only in fragments — old foundations long ago embraced by roots and moss.

Rituals, dances, and druidic magic all serve one purpose: to protect the forest's balance and the Nature Shard that sustains it.

Outsiders rarely see this place. Those allowed in are watched by both Sylvari and the forest itself.

## Important Landmarks

- **The Elderbloom Ziggurat**: Formerly a stone pyramid ages ago, it is now completely consumed by the Elderbloom tree. Roots have split the old stone and grown through it, reshaping the once-angular structure into a breathtaking living monument, glowing with emerald light. It is the holiest place in the Expanse.
- **The Corkgrove Villages**: Therion settlements surrounded by vineyards, cork forests, and rolling farmland.
- **The Whispering Plains**: A wide field where wind through tall grass is said to carry messages from forest spirits.
- **The River Solenne**: A long, peaceful river that nourishes farms before disappearing into the jungle's depths.

## Capital – Verdancia

As Verdancia transitions inward, the city dissolves into the living forest. Stone streets fade into soft moss paths, and buildings shift into homes grown from hollowed trunks or flowering canopies. Bridges of braided vines sway gently between massive branches, and lanterns of bioluminescent petals illuminate the spiraling paths.

At the very center stands the **Elderbloom**, a colossal tree whose roots cradle the Nature Shard in a hollow of glowing amber. Its branches form a cathedral-like vault overhead, leaves shimmering with soft emerald luminescence.

This heart-forest is silent, sacred, and alive — the spiritual core of the Sylvari and the living soul of the Expanse.
