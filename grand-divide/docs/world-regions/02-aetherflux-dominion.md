# The Aetherflux Dominion

**Elemental Shard**: Lightning Shard  
**Real-World Parallel**: A blend of Industrial Revolution–era London and modern America, with elements of Art Deco futurism

## Geographic Overview

Aetherflux sprawls across a vast, storm-wracked plateau where lightning storms dance endlessly across metal spires and aetheric towers. The land hums with static energy — the very air alive with power drawn from the Lightning Shard buried deep beneath its central city. Rivers of pale-blue current flow through glass conduits, and floating tramways link massive industrial complexes to towering citadels of learning. Nights are never dark here; the glow of invention keeps the skies bright.

## Role in the World

The Dominion stands as Vaeloran's crucible of innovation and discovery. It is where artifice, alchemy, and arcane science meet — the frontier of both knowledge and danger. While other nations fear the power of the Shards, Aetherflux seeks to master them. They supply most of the continent's advanced constructs, aethertech weapons, and enchanted tools. Their engineers and scholars travel widely, often seen as both saviors and meddlers.

## Culture & Society

Knowledge in Aetherflux is sacred — and free. Its great universities, foremost the Aetherflux Academy, are open to any who can pass the entrance trials. The people see ignorance as the only true sin, and learning as the highest virtue.

Society is meritocratic, governed by a council of guilds and scholars rather than nobility. Valken serve as tireless laborers and assistants, while Eldari push the boundaries of invention, blending artistry and intellect. However, the endless drive to progress has begun to strain the balance between machine and soul.

## Important Landmarks

- **Aetherflux Academy**: The greatest university in Vaeloran, devoted to the unification of magic and science.
- **Stormspire Core**: A titanic aetheric tower channeling lightning from the Shard; visible from across the Dominion.
- **Machinal District**: The industrial heart, filled with foundries, steam engines, and automaton workshops.
- **The Vault of Sparks**: A subterranean research facility sealed since the War of Shards — said to hold failed experiments.

## Capital – Arcopolis

A gleaming city of steel and crystal, Arcopolis stands as the embodiment of progress. Its skyline is dominated by spiraling towers of glass and brass, each housing laboratories, observatories, or manufactories. Flying trams crisscross the skies, and mechanical servitors roam its streets. Lightning rods and storm collectors crown every building, channeling raw power into the city's radiant grid.
