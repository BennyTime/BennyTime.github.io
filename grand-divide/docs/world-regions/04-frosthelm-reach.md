# Frosthelm Reach

**Elemental Shard**: Ice Shard  
**Real-World Parallel**: Nordic + Russian kingdoms — hardy, snow-bound societies with strong community ties

## Geographic Overview

Frosthelm stretches across snow-laden mountains, frozen tundras, dense taiga forests, and icy river valleys. Rolling plains and deep forests provide hunting grounds, while the Glacier Spire, the resting place of the Ice Shard, dominates the horizon. Aurora-filled nights illuminate frozen lakes, and small settlements cling to rivers and forests where resources are most abundant. The landscape blends the stark grandeur of Scandinavia with the vast expanse and harsh winters of Siberia.

## Role in the World

Frosthelm is Vaeloran's bastion of endurance and fortitude. Its people are unmatched in navigating snow, ice, and forested terrain, excelling in survival, hunting, and defense. While outsiders may see them as austere or stoic, Frosthelm's warriors and tacticians are essential allies in times of war, and their wisdom is often sought for navigating harsh climates.

## Culture and Society

Life in Frosthelm demands discipline, cooperation, and respect for the cold's power. Communities revolve around extended clans, where elders teach survival, combat, and craftsmanship. Fire and ice are central motifs in festivals and storytelling, celebrating past victories and winter endurance rituals.

Architecture fuses Nordic longhouses and watchtowers with Russian-style onion domes and decorative woodwork, particularly in temples, halls, and council buildings. Music, chanting, and epic poetry preserve history, and warm communal halls serve as cultural hubs during the long winters.

Religious and spiritual life emphasizes harmony with the ice and forest spirits, endurance, and the idea that strength is shown through resilience rather than conquest.

## Important Landmarks

## Capital – Frosthelm Keep

Perched on a high plateau and encircled by mountains and frozen rivers, Frosthelm Keep is built to withstand both blizzards and sieges. Its towers rise like icy spires, adorned with carved wood and painted domes. Heated halls allow craftsmen, warriors, and scholars to gather safely, while snow-laden streets connect marketplaces, guild halls, and temples. The city embodies Frosthelm's dual spirit: resilience and community.
