# The Concordant Plains

**Real-World Parallel**: Italy / Geneva — Center for diplomacy, commerce, cultural exchange

## Geographic Overview

At the center of Vaeloran stretch the fertile Concordant Plains, reborn from the scarred battlefields of the Grand Divide. Rolling grasslands, clear rivers, and wind-carved ridges form a land without extremes — fitting for the heart of neutrality. The skies above are busy with airships and banners of every nation converging upon Eldwyn Vale, the shining city of peace.

## Role in the World

Once a crossroads of war, the Plains became the site of the Treaty of Unity, declaring it neutral ground for all peoples. Now, it stands as a hub of diplomacy, commerce, and discovery — where no army may march and no shard may rest. The Wardens of Concord protect its peace, ensuring that ambition never again breaks its balance.

## Culture & Society

The Plains thrive on coexistence. Scholars, artisans, and dreamers from every nation gather here, bound by shared ideals of progress and unity. Faiths intermingle, magic is taught freely, and debate replaces battle. Beneath the calm, however, old rivalries simmer — and the city's peace depends on constant vigilance.

## Important Landmarks

- **Eldwyn Vale**: The capital of peace and cooperation; a city without walls or kings.
- **Hall of Accord**: Circular council chamber where all nations meet as equals.
- **Scholar's Promenade**: A sprawling quarter of libraries and academies open to all.

## Capital – Eldwyn Vale

A marvel of diplomacy and design, Eldwyn Vale stands where armies once clashed — now rebuilt as a city without walls. The architecture blends every culture in harmony: marble spires from Luminara beside glass towers from Aetherflux, stone courtyards grown over with Sylvari vines. Airships drift lazily overhead, ferrying scholars and merchants from across the world. In its heart lies the Crystal Plaza, a vast circular square engraved with the symbols of all shards — save one empty space, left for peace itself.
