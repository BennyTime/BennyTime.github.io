# Kaen no Kuni

**Elemental Shard**: Fire Shard  
**Real-World Parallel**: Feudal Japan — disciplined, honor-bound, and militarily advanced

## Geographic Overview

Ignareth stretches across volcanic highlands, dense bamboo forests, and terraced hills. Rivers of molten rock flow through certain regions, shaping the land into natural fortresses and sacred sites. The sky is often tinged with ash and smoke, giving the lands a fierce, fiery atmosphere. Mountain passes and coastal ports serve as trade and defense points, while cherry blossom groves and tranquil temples contrast the otherwise harsh terrain.

## Role in the World

Ignareth is the continent's martial heart, home to strict codes of honor, guilds of artisans, and disciplined armies. The Korveth dominate governance, enforcing law and tradition, while the Dravari (especially fire-adapted clans) serve as warriors, guardians, and emissaries. Its position atop the Fire Shard makes it a source of magical power and conflict, often supplying elite soldiers or mercenaries across Vaeloran.

## Culture & Society

Society revolves around hierarchy, respect, and discipline. Clan loyalty is paramount, and each citizen's duty defines their social standing. Martial arts, swordsmanship, and elemental mastery are taught from a young age. Art and poetry flourish alongside war, reflecting a culture of beauty intertwined with strength. Festivals honor the Fire Shard and ancestral spirits, combining pageantry with martial demonstrations.

The **Way of Contained Flame** is the nation's philosophical foundation, emphasizing restraint, honor, and the idea that true strength comes from controlling one's power rather than unleashing it recklessly.

## Important Landmarks

- **Korveth-Kami**: The capital fortress-city, perched atop volcanic cliffs.

## Capital – Korveth-Kami

Korveth-Kami is a marvel of disciplined architecture: layered fortresses, wooden pagodas, and lava-heated bathhouses dominate the cityscape. The city is both a military stronghold and cultural center, with schools for swordsmanship, strategy, and elemental mastery. Streets bustle with merchants, warriors, and scholars, all adhering to a strict code of order.
