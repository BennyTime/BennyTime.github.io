# Thundarkar Range

**Elemental Shard**: Earth Shard  
**Real-World Parallel**: Swiss Alps grandeur fused with Tibetan verticality, Mongolian resolve, and the architectural marvel of impossible dwarven megastructures

## Geographic Overview

The Thundarkar Range is a kingdom of mountains that should not exist — jagged peaks rising at angles that seem to mock gravity; cliff faces suspended in perfect symmetry, and plateaus carved so precisely they almost appear artificial. The land itself bears the unmistakable touch of the Earth Shard; stone here is not just matter but memory, shaped by ancient hands and living resonance.

Massive arches of seamless granite bridge valleys miles across. Entire mountainsides have been hollowed out into spiraling cities, their surfaces etched with runic geometry that glows faintly at dusk. Waterfalls plunge from impossible angles, splitting into mist midair before rejoining in perfect harmony.

Tremors echo constantly beneath the stone, not violent but rhythmic — the steady heartbeat of the mountains themselves.

## Role in the World

Thundarkar is the architectural and structural backbone of Vaeloran. The continent's greatest fortresses, aqueducts, keeps, bridges, shrines, and monuments were designed by Durakken stonewrights and carved from Thundarkari stone. Their constructions are so precise and enduring that other nations often believe them to be magical in nature.

The Range exports unbreakable stone, gravity-defying constructs, rune-engineered frameworks, and earth-attuned artisans capable of shaping entire landscapes. Where others see rock, the Durakken see potential.

Though slow to involve themselves in politics, their mastery makes them indispensable and their approval, or disapproval, can shift the balance of entire nations.

## Culture & Society

Thundarkari society is built on craft, patience, and monumental design. Every settlement is both a home and a masterpiece, each block carved to fit a cosmic rhythm known to the Durakken as the **Stone Song** - the belief that all stone has a true form waiting to be revealed.

Stonewrights are held in the highest honor. Architects are treated as philosophers. Engineers are revered as spiritual guides.

Every generation strives to build something that will last until the end of ages, and their structures often incorporate feats that defy ordinary engineering:

- Suspended bridges with no visible supports
- Inverted towers spiraling downward into the mountain
- Citadels balanced atop needle-thin pillars
- Entire cities carved into the undersides of cliffs

Their religion centers on **Stonefather Grondyr**, the first shaper, who taught the mountains to stand and the earth to breathe. Artistic expression takes the form of sculpture, runic murals, and harmonic lithophone music played upon resonant stone slabs. Community life is disciplined but warm; taverns echo with laughter, boasting contests, and tales of earth-shaping miracles.

## Important Landmarks

- **Gronndel Cradle** – The impossible cavern where the Earth Shard rests, its ceiling held aloft by a single seamless pillar of unknown make.
- **Echoing Deep** – A runic labyrinth whose walls resonate with harmony when walked in certain patterns.
- **The Tectonic Lake** – A lake made from the impact of a meteor from long ago.
- **Pillars of Orun** – Natural stone columns reshaped into towering sanctuaries and homes, stretching miles into the air.

## Capital - Stoneheart Hold

Stoneheart Hold is carved not upon a mountain, but within a mountain that has been reshaped into a living monument. From afar it appears as though the peak has been sculpted by divine chisels: tiered terraces, spiraling towers, and massive open windows carved directly into the stone.

Inside lies a vertical city that descends for miles. Light is carried deep within through crystalline shafts that refract sunlight into kaleidoscopic brilliance. Bridges crisscross open spaces carved from the heart of the mountain, some suspended by nothing but runic intention.

At the center of all things rests the **Grand Litharium**, a vast circular hall where stone sings under the touch of artisans, engineers debate over designs that span decades, and oaths are carved into the **Pillar of Truth** — a monolith said to crumble only when a sworn promise is broken. The entire city stands as the Durakken's greatest declaration: "Stone does not bend to the impossible — it creates it."
