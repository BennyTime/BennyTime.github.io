# Aquaris, the Rideborn Empire

**Elemental Shard**: Water Shard  
**Real-World Parallel**: Ancient China and the Tang Dynasty — a civilization of grace, balance, and hidden depths

## Geographic Overview

Aquaria rests along the southern coasts of Vaeloran, where jade-green cliffs descend into the endless Sapphire Expanse. The nation is divided between two realms: the surface harbors and river-cities that cling to the shores, and the vast submerged metropolises that shimmer beneath the waves. Coral towers and crystal domes form the undersea capital, linked by glowing canals and bioluminescent thoroughfares. The Water Shard rests within the Abyssal Palace — a sanctum of living glass beneath the deepest trench, its pulse said to guide the tides themselves.

## Role in the World

Aquaria stands as the spiritual heart of Vaeloran, the keeper of balance and flow. Its scholars and mystics serve as diplomats, healers, and navigators, their fleets guiding trade and exploration across the seas. The empire's deep archives preserve ancient songs and prophecies dating back before the Grand Divide, many of which foretell the return of the ocean's fury should the balance of the elements be broken again. Though peaceful by nature, Aquaria's mastery of the tides makes it a formidable power, its fleets capable of striking silently from the depths.

## Culture & Society

The Aquarian people live by the belief that every soul is a droplet in the greater ocean of existence — destined to flow, merge, and eventually return to the source. Central to this philosophy is the pursuit of **Ascendance**, the long-held belief that through enlightenment, devotion, and harmony with water's essence, one may transcend the mortal form and become a **Nerathi** — a radiant being of pure light and current, said to dwell in the deepest sanctuaries of the sea.

This pursuit shapes all of Aquaria's culture: art mirrors the ebb and flow of water; meditation is done to the rhythm of the tides; and those nearing enlightenment are venerated as living saints. Yet, beneath this serene ideal lies quiet tension — the pressure to achieve transcendence divides the faithful from those who simply wish to live mortal lives.

## Important Landmarks

- **Abyssal Palace**: The seat of the Tidecourt and resting place of the Water Shard, carved from transparent crystal beneath the ocean floor.
- **Pearlspire**: A coastal citadel bridging land and sea, where trade with surface nations flows through its vast tidal gates.
- **Whispering Depths**: A labyrinth of glowing trenches said to hold echoes of ancient sea spirits.
- **Moonmirror Port**: A surface harbor where the reflection of the full moon is used in ritual divination.
- **The Depthless Sanctum**: A forbidden abyss said to be home to the Nerathi — the enlightened souls who transcended mortality.

## Capital – Namaris

Hidden beneath the tranquil surface of the Sapphire Expanse, Namaris is a breathtaking undersea city of coral spires, living crystal, and drifting lanterns. The rhythm of its tides dictates daily life — work, prayer, and rest all flow with the ocean's pulse. Songs of whales and soft bells echo through its domes, blending into a ceaseless hymn to the sea. Above it, shimmering currents weave through the water like threads of silk, carrying messages and travelers between the surface and the depths.
