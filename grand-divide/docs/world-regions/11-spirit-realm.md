# Spirit Realm

**Note**: Unlike other regions, the Spirit Realm is not a physical nation but a dimensional plane that overlays the Mortal Realm.

## Geographic Overview

The Spirit Realm is a dimension layered atop Vaeloran like a translucent veil — neither distant nor reachable by ordinary means. Its landscapes defy physical law: rivers flowing upward into glowing basins, mountains dissolving into petals, and starlit fields blooming with emotion-sensitive flora. Every surface hums with gentle spiritual resonance. 

But its most defining feature lies deeper: **This is where all souls go when their mortal journey ends.**

Every life — whether saint, tyrant, beast, or king — converges toward the Spirit Realm in a drifting stream of luminous essence. These soul-rivers wander the realm like celestial currents, carrying memories and emotion into the great cycle of rebirth.

Only the Aelvar can traverse the realm freely, their own essence naturally attuned to its tides. Others who enter without guidance may fall into dreams, illusions, or the echo-maze of their own unresolved spirit.

## Role in the World

The Spirit Realm is Vaeloran's spiritual engine — the silent mechanism through which life, death, and rebirth are maintained. The Aelvar do not rule it so much as shepherd its balance.

Here, souls:
- Release their burdens
- Merge with the flow of life-energy
- Are guided back into the mortal world
- Or remain, becoming spirits, guardians, or echoes

During the War of Shards, this delicate flow nearly collapsed. Too many lives were cut short, emotions tore violently through the veil, and soul-streams fragmented. The Aelvar's intervention prevented total spiritual collapse — a truth known only to a handful outside their realm.

To the mortal nations, the Spirit Realm is myth. To the Aelvar, it is sacred duty. To every soul, it is home.

## Culture & Society

Aelvar culture revolves around three eternal principles that bind them to their duty as custodians of the soul-flow:

- **Reflection** — accepting one's past, so the spirit may move freely
- **Resonance** — aligning one's essence with the greater harmony
- **Transcendence** — becoming a guide for others on the cycle of existence

Their settlements are serene sanctuaries floating between reality and dream. Spiritforged bridges connect shrines shaped from moonlight and memory. Blossoms fall eternally yet never land, swirling in currents of emotion.

Aelvar are peaceful, but not helpless. Their warriors — the **Soulbound Sentinels** — wield spirit-tempered weapons that alter form with the wielder's emotional state. Their healers mend both body and soul. They rarely intervene in mortal affairs, but when the balance of souls is threatened, the Aelvar act through subtle dreams, whispers, or the rare envoy.

## Inhabitants

| Type | Percentage | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Aelvar | 5% | Native soul-tuned race; custodians of the spirit-flow |
| Souls | 95% | Spirits of all who have died across Vaeloran — wandering echoes, resting memories, reincarnating essences, and ascended guardians |

## The Sundering

During the Shard War, the Spirit Realm experienced a catastrophic overflow known as **The Sundering**. Too many souls died too quickly, and the natural cycle of death and rebirth couldn't process them all. Many souls became trapped, unable to pass on.

This event created:
- Ghostly manifestations across Vaeloran
- Lingering echoes of unresolved deaths
- Irregular soul currents that persist even today

The return of the gods, particularly Nyssara (Goddess of Finality), has largely stabilized the realm, but remnants of The Sundering still occasionally surface.

## Access to the Spirit Realm

- **Aelvar** can enter and exit freely through natural rifts in the veil
- **Death** naturally brings all souls to the Spirit Realm
- **Powerful magic** can create temporary passages, though this is dangerous
- **Divine intervention** from Nyssara or other death-associated deities
- **Near-death experiences** sometimes grant brief glimpses

:::warning
Entering the Spirit Realm while alive without proper guidance is extremely dangerous. Mortals risk becoming lost, trapped, or having their souls drawn into the cycle prematurely.
