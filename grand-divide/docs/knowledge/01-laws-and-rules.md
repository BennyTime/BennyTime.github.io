# Laws & Unspoken Rules

The following laws and customs govern life across Vaeloran:

## Universal Laws

- **Time magic is outlawed across all known nations.** Violation carries severe penalties including exile, imprisonment, or erasure from official record.
- **The Concordant Plains are neutral ground.** No army may march there, and violence within its borders is strictly forbidden.
- **No nation can claim another's Shard.** The Elemental Shards are sacred to their homeland and attempts to steal them are considered acts of war.

## Widely Observed Rules

- Unregulated necromancy and soulmancy is considered taboo and often illegal. The practice of it is still shunned by communities.
- The assassination of a Concordant Plains mediator or diplomat is considered a global crime, even in times of war.
- Contracts are binding beyond legality, especially those made with Daemon or witnessed by divine entities.
- Shard-based research is heavily regulated across all nations.
- Slavery is illegal in most nations, except for the Umbra Court, which is frowned upon by the other nations.

## Cultural Expectations

- **In Kaen no Kuni**, honor and fire rites dictate interactions. Insulting a clan or refusing a duel can have severe consequences.
- **In Umbral Court**, subtlety and diplomacy are key. Aggressive behavior may result in assassination attempts or blackmail.
- **In Eldwyn Vale**, decorum is expected. Shouting or breaking decorum in the Hall of Accord can void treaties or start political disputes.
- **In Aerion**, respecting the Sky Mother and the rituals of the Windspire Academy is essential. Even small disrespect can lead to ostracization.
- **In Lumineth Sanctum**, doctrinal dissent is not tolerated. The Church of the Eternal Radiance maintains absolute authority over matters of faith and law.
