# Widely Known Facts

Facts that most educated people across Vaeloran would know:

## About the World

- **Black market exists and operates across borders.** The Shadow Rift Exchange in the Umbra Court is the largest known nexus.
- **The gods left for a time, but now are back** and roam the world, interacting with mortals in physical forms.
- **Elemental shards are forces of nature.** They shape the lands around them and grant unique powers to those nearby.
- **Everything before the calendar has been forgotten or burnt.** Even the reason for the Shard War has been lost to time.

## About Death and Spirits

- On death, souls pass into the Spirit Realm, where they are tested to see if they are fit for reincarnation or simply are left to be rehabilitated.
- The Aelvar serve as custodians of the Spirit Realm, guiding souls through the cycle of death and rebirth.
- The Sundering caused many souls to become trapped, unable to pass on properly. This has largely been resolved since the gods' return.

## About the Daemon

- **The Daemon are not evil.** They are a corporation that live in their own realm that offer contracts to the people of Vaeloran.
- These contracts aren't focused on magical power (unless you are a warlock), mostly being tied to knowledge.
- Contracts made by the Supervisors and the CEO are different and carry greater weight.
- The Daemon reclaimed contract-making power from the Erekar in recent history, fundamentally changing Erekar society.

## About Magic and Technology

- Aetherflux leads the world in magical technology and innovation.
- Luxmetal can only be forged in Lumineth Sanctum and is considered sacred.
- Valken are recognized as people, not constructs, though this is a relatively recent development.
- The Plasari exist among all societies, though their origins remain mysterious.

## Current Events

- Cross-continental trade has stabilized through treaties and adventurer protection.
- Disappearances of important figures have been reported across multiple nations.
