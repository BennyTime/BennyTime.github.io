# Legends & Folklore

Tales, rumors, and legends whispered across Vaeloran:

## Regional Legends

### Frosthelm Reach
- **The Glass Wolf**: A spectral wolf that walks across frozen lakes. Seeing it is said to bring either a great blessing or a winter of endless blizzards.
- **The Ironback Drake**: A beast said to roam the Thundarkar Range with indestructible scales. Any who ride it are doomed to vanish into the mountains forever.

### Aerion Skydrift
- Aerion's high skies are rumored to hide islands that only appear when the Eye of Aeria opens. Pilots who search for them never return, or so the story goes.
- **The River of Stars**: A river that only flows during eclipses. Anyone who steps into it is granted the memory of a life they never lived.

### The Concordant Plains
- **The Endless Stack**: A hidden library where every treaty ever broken writes itself in ink that glows faintly in moonlight.
- **The Lost Airship of Solenne**: A vessel that appeared once carrying a cargo of Luxmetal that no one has ever recovered.

### The Umbra Court
- Deep in the Veilwood Forest, it is said a single tree moves every night to hide a treasure chest full of forbidden knowledge. The chest is cursed, and opening it without permission can erase one's shadow.

### Aquaris
- **The Moonwhale**: A luminescent sea creature that appears once every decade and can whisper the future to those who catch it.

### Aetherflux
- **The Clockwork Menagerie**: A hidden factory said to create sentient automata that vanish when humans approach. Some believe it was built by scholars who tried to outsmart death.

### Kaen no Kuni
- **The Fire Spirit of Korveth-Kami**: A wandering flame that tests the honor of warriors. Those who fail are consumed in spirit, not body, leaving behind a walking soulless husk.

### Viridalis
- Sylvari are rumored to hold a grove where shadows bloom into flowers at night. Anyone who picks one may find themselves walking in dreams rather than reality.

## General Mysteries

- **Some say the Daemon occasionally leave tokens in the mortal world** which grant a small boon but mark the recipient for future debt.
- Many believe that each Elemental Shard grants its bearer immense power over its element, though attempts to wield them without proper attunement often lead to disaster.
- **There are rumors of a Shard Convergence**, when multiple Shards align. It is said that the world itself trembles and new lands or creatures may appear.
- Some sages claim that each Shard has a will of its own, as if they can hear, feel, think.
- **Word of mouth says that users of time magic still exist in the current era**, hidden from the world despite the Absolute Temporal Prohibition.
