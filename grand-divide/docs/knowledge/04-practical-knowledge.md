# Practical Knowledge for Adventurers

Essential information for those traveling across Vaeloran.

## Travel & Transportation

- **Airships and Windwings are the fastest way** to cross Vaeloran's major nations, but tickets are expensive and often require permits for shard-adjacent regions.
- Roads can be treacherous; bandit activity is common, especially on the left continent.
- Tides, storms, and magical phenomena may make travel unpredictable near Aquaria, Aerion, and Thundarkar Range.
- The Concordant Plains are neutral; travelers should respect local rules or face fines, imprisonment, or diplomatic complications.

## Currency & Trade

- After the end of the Shard War, a unified currency was created and is accepted across most nations.
- Black market trades are rumored everywhere, but discretion is critical.
- Contracts with shadowy groups like Daemon intermediaries are legally binding and rarely forgiving.
- Shard-related items are tightly controlled. Selling or transporting them illegally can incur extreme penalties.

## Combat & Hazards

- Magical anomalies are common near Shards; elemental surges may occur randomly.
- Necromantic and soul-related magics are dangerous and socially unacceptable; even possessing unbound talismans may bring suspicion.
- Monster knowledge is invaluable: even minor threats like shadow wolves in Umbral Court or sand wyrms in the Sunscorch Expanse can kill unprepared adventurers.
- Prepare for environmental extremes: eternal night in Umbra Court, scorching desert heat in Sunscorch Expanse, freezing cold in Frosthelm.

## Lodging & Provisions

- Most cities have inns for all budgets, but some are seasonal (like the Winter Market of Zimograd).
- Outside urban centers, travelers must prepare for food scarcity, magical hazards, and extreme climates.
- Herbal remedies, elemental wards, and weather-resistant gear are highly recommended.
- Water and food from near Shard sites may be contaminated with elemental energy.

## Communication & Magic

- Sending stones, airship messengers, and magical signal spells exist, but require approval in some nations.
- Rune-based or Shard-infused messages are regulated and often monitored for espionage.
- Learning local languages, magical dialects, or sigils increases survival chances dramatically.
- Common is widely spoken, but showing respect through local language is appreciated.

## Adventurer Reputation & Guilds

- **Joining local guilds** (mercenary, merchant, scholar, or magic-focused) can unlock contracts, resources, and safe passage.
- Fame spreads quickly in Vaeloran. Actions may open opportunities or invite rival adventurers.
- Mercenary guilds often operate under local or shard-based law. Ignoring regulations can result in expulsion or bounty.
- The **Adventurers' Compact** in Eldwyn Vale provides licenses and dispute mediation. Most major cities recognize Compact seals, especially for bounties and dungeon claims.

## Regional Etiquette

### Kaen no Kuni
Honor and fire rites dictate interactions. Never insult a clan or refuse a formal duel.

### Umbral Court
Subtlety and diplomacy are essential. Direct aggression invites retaliation.

### Eldwyn Vale
Maintain decorum in the Hall of Accord. Disruptions can void treaties.

### Aerion Skydrift
Respect the Sky Mother and Windspire Academy rituals. Disrespect leads to ostracization.

### Lumineth Sanctum
Follow church doctrine. Doctrinal dissent is dangerous.

### Viridalis Expanse
Never enter the inner forest without permission. The Sylvari guard it jealously.

### Aquaris
Respect tidal rituals and the pursuit of Ascendance.

### Frosthelm Reach
Show strength and honor. Weakness invites contempt.

### Thundarkar Range
Admire craftsmanship and never disparage stonework.

### Aetherflux Dominion
Knowledge is sacred. Willful ignorance is offensive.
