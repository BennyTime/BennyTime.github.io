# The Realms

The cosmology of existence beyond the mortal world.

## Mortal Realm

The physical world where most adventures take place. Time flows normally, matter is stable, and life is bound by birth and death. All other realms influence the Mortal Realm indirectly, but none replace it as the primary stage of existence.

## Divine Realm

The domain of gods, demigods, and divine concepts. Reality here is shaped by belief, authority, and cosmic law rather than physical rules. The gods reside here when not walking among mortals.

## Spirit Realm

A transitory realm tied to life, death, and natural cycles. Mortal souls pass through the Spirit Realm after death before reincarnation, judgment, or dissolution. The Aelvar serve as its custodians.

## Darkness Realm

A realm of entropy, decay, and erasure. Unlike the Spirit Realm, souls consumed here are lost, not recycled. This is where daemons and void entities live. It represents the antithesis of creation.

## Dream Realm

A mutable realm shaped by thought, emotion, and imagination. It overlaps both the Mortal and Spirit Realms during sleep, visions, and altered states. Source of dreams, nightmares, and prophecy. Somnyr, the Sleepless Star, holds dominion here.

## Fey Realm

A distorted reflection of the Mortal Realm where nature, emotion, and instinct dominate. Time flows unpredictably, and reality responds to intent and ritual. Home of fey, tricksters, and ancient nature beings.

## Astral Realm

The vast expanse between realms. It is not a destination but a medium through which planar travel occurs. Used for teleportation and planar transit. An endless silver void where thought becomes direction.

## Planar Interactions

- Travel between realms is possible but dangerous
- The Spirit Realm and Mortal Realm have the closest connection
- The Darkness Realm actively seeks to consume other realms
- The Dream and Fey Realms occasionally overlap with the Mortal Realm
- The Divine Realm is largely inaccessible to mortals without divine intervention
