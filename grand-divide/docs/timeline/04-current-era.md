# Current Era (901-1109)

## 901 to 1000 – Modern Concordant Era

### The Daemon Intervention

- In the early years of the era, scholars and priests independently confirm the existence of beings older than recorded history — the **Daemon**, primordial entities operating through rigid hierarchies, binding clauses, and absolute enforcement of bargains.
- The Daemon intervene directly in mortal affairs for the first time, not through war, but through contractual reclamation. Ancient agreements, predating even the Shard War, are invoked and enforced without negotiation.
- As a result, Erekar lose their innate ability to forge soul-binding and sin-bound contracts. The power is not destroyed — it is reclaimed by the Daemon as proprietary authority.

### Erekar Transformation

- Erekar society undergoes a profound transformation. Stripped of their defining leverage, many abandon mercenary hierarchies and shadow dominion, slowly integrating as a more conventional people with culture, family lines, and law.
- While resentment simmers, widespread conflict does not erupt. Erekar violence declines, and their reputation shifts from existential threat to wary distrust.
- The Umbral Court, having relied heavily on Erekar contract power, suffers a sharp decline in influence. Vanyr houses turn inward, focusing on political survival rather than expansion.
- The Daemon establish indirect presence across Vaeloran through intermediaries, clauses embedded in ancient law, and whispers of "binding precedent." They do not rule — but their authority is undeniable.

### The Plasari Revelation

- During this period, a previously obscure people step into public awareness: the **Plasari**. Known for their mutable forms and resistance to Shard resonance, they appear across multiple nations simultaneously, claiming long histories within each.
- The revelation causes widespread unease. Records confirm Plasari identities retroactively, as if they had always been there — neighbors, scholars, merchants — unnoticed until now.
- Unlike Erekar or Valken, Plasari display no inherent connection to Shards, making them invaluable as mediators, explorers, and neutral observers in a fractured world.
- Academic interest in the Plasari surges, particularly in Aetherflux and Eldwyn Vale, though Plasari communities remain deliberately decentralized and resistant to classification.

### The Temporal Catastrophe

- A catastrophic temporal experiment — its details sealed across all nations — results in irreversible timeline destabilization, including erased individuals, contradictory histories, and regions briefly existing in multiple states at once.
- In response, the Concordant Council issues the **Absolute Temporal Prohibition**, unanimously banning all forms of time magic, chronomancy, retrocausal divination, and temporal artifact use.
- Enforcement of the ban is universal and uncompromising. Even research into theoretical temporal mechanics becomes grounds for exile, imprisonment, or erasure from official record.
- The Concordant Plains regain renewed importance, not as an enforcer, but as the sole recognized authority on forbidden practices, maintaining sealed vaults and black archives inaccessible to all but appointed custodians.
- Brannok openly supports the ban, declaring that time is not a resource to be negotiated, corrected, or conquered — but endured. His stance becomes doctrine across most nations.
- The Spirit Realm shows subtle signs of strain following the temporal incident, reinforcing the belief that time manipulation threatens not just mortals, but existence itself.

### Fragile Stability

- By the end of the era, Vaeloran is more stable on the surface than it has been in centuries — yet beneath that stability lie unresolved powers: the Daemon's silent authority, the Plasari's unknown origins, and secrets buried in forbidden time.
- The era closes with a shared understanding: peace now exists, but it is brittle, and the rules that preserve it are built on fear of what has already gone wrong.

## 1001 to 1100 – Current Years

### Growing Unrest

- Umbral Court black-market operations surge; high-ranking merchants, scholars, and diplomats begin disappearing under mysterious circumstances, affecting multiple nations' politics and trade.
- Gravahlren settlements near Frosthelm report entire hunting and mining parties vanishing, sparking concern among Frosthelm and nearby Therion traders.
- Mysterious phenomena disrupt Skyserpent migrations across Aerion and Aerion-adjacent trade routes, impacting aerial commerce with Aetherflux and Aquaris.

### Mysterious Occurrences

- Plasari are increasingly spotted in major cities and frontier regions, sometimes in disguise, creating intrigue, suspicion, and unusual alliances.
- Widespread crop failures in parts of Viridalis and southern Frosthelm coincide with strange weather anomalies, prompting joint investigation from multiple nations.
- The Concordant Plains face internal unrest as minor nations push for representation and enforcement reforms, threatening the historic role of Eldwyn Vale as a peace hub.

### Artifacts and Investigations

- Luxmetal artifacts are stolen from different regions—Aetherflux, Lumineth Sanctum, and Aquaris—and occasionally resurface in dangerous experiments or black-market dealings, sparking cross-continental investigations.
- Minor temporal disturbances flare in disparate regions, prompting renewed enforcement of the Absolute Temporal Prohibition.
- Ancient ruins and Shard-imbued relics in disparate regions begin spontaneously activating, attracting scholars, mercenaries, and adventurers, hinting at larger, unseen threats.

### The Adventurer's Response

- Eldwyn Vale's Adventurer's Hub reports a surge of cross-continent expeditions, as growing uncertainty pushes people to seek protection, knowledge, or profit beyond their homelands.
- Eldwyn Vale establishes cross-regional adventuring parties within the Adventurer's Hub, deliberately recruiting individuals from multiple nations and cultures to promote cooperation, understanding, and shared experience across Vaeloran. 
- These parties serve as both diplomatic envoys and practical problem-solvers, becoming a subtle but influential force in maintaining fragile unity.

## Current Year: 1109

The world stands at a crossroads. The gods walk among mortals, the Daemon's influence grows, and ancient powers stir. Adventurers from all nations gather in Eldwyn Vale, drawn by destiny, necessity, or ambition. 

The Grand Divide that once tore the world apart may yet return—or it may be the very thing that unites it.
