# Modern Eras

## 551 to 700 – Age of Treaties

### Renewed Diplomacy

- The Concordant Plains regain prominence as the world's central neutral ground, not through authority or force, but through necessity, hosting dozens of bilateral treaties, trade accords, and non-aggression pacts.
- While the Concordant Council lacks enforcement power, its halls become the default meeting place for resolving disputes too dangerous to ignore.
- Lingering fear from the Age of Skirmishes drives nations to favor treaties over open conflict, even as trust remains fragile and conditional.

### Kaen no Kuni's Rise as Mediator

- Kaen no Kuni emerges as a stabilizing diplomatic force, exporting mediators and warrior-envoys trained in the Way of Contained Flame, emphasizing restraint, honor, and limited engagement.
- The outer regions of Viridalis, dominated by Therion lords rather than Sylvari guardians, reopen cautiously to foreign trade, relying on negotiated protections rather than isolationist force.

### The Plasari Emergence

- Several negotiations succeed unexpectedly, often attributed to neutral intermediaries whose identities are inconsistently recorded across participating nations.
- Historical records from this era contain multiple references to treaty witnesses whose physical descriptions, race, or origin vary between accounts, a discrepancy quietly attributed to translation errors or poor documentation.
- Lumineth Sanctum scholars expand Shard-detection theory after encountering sentient beings who fail to register meaningful Shard resonance, classifying them as rare anomalies rather than threats.
- Aetherflux archivists note recurring cases of individuals appearing across decades under different names and appearances, concluding—officially—that the phenomenon is the result of identity inheritance or clerical overlap.

### Cultural Healing

- Though organized hunts of earlier eras have ended, cultural fear of "formless infiltrators" persists in folklore, sermons, and border policies, reinforcing suspicion of outsiders and travelers.
- Brannok's festivals continue to spread across neutral lands, acting as informal diplomatic spaces where grudges soften, and negotiations begin away from council halls.
- Trade routes stabilize gradually as treaties accumulate, creating fragile but functional networks of land, sea, and sky commerce once thought permanently broken.
- The Age of Treaties ends with the realization that peace is no longer enforced by Concordant decree, but sustained by shared memory of loss, fear of collapse, and the quiet labor of those who ensure conflicts end before they begin.

## 701 to 900 – Age of the Return of Gods

### The Return

- The gods return to Vaeloran in physical, restrained forms, shaped by mortal perception and the limitations of their long absence. Though diminished, their presence is unmistakably divine.
- Initial panic spreads across the world as faith becomes reality. Crowds flee, pray, riot, or gather in awe, unsure whether gods walking the land herald salvation or judgment.
- The fear does not last. The gods act openly and benevolently—healing wounded lands, calming lingering Shard instabilities, restoring ruined sanctuaries, and aiding mortals without demanding obedience.
- As trust grows, reverence replaces panic. Worship becomes personal again, not institutional or imposed. Faith is rekindled rather than enforced.

### Brannok's Role

- Brannok, already bound to the mortal world, becomes the first point of contact between gods and mortals—not as a ruler or enforcer, but as a guide to the changed world.
- Brannok explains to the returning gods that Vaeloran has learned to govern itself, that peace now exists through cooperation rather than divine mandate. The gods accept this reality, adjusting their roles accordingly.
- Concordant Plains become the primary meeting ground between gods and mortals. Rather than ruling from it, the gods treat it as sacred neutral soil, reinforcing its role as the world's center of peace.

### National Reactions

- **Lumineth Sanctum** embraces the return as holy affirmation, but is forced to reform as the gods refuse to legitimize absolute clerical authority, weakening the Sanctum's theocratic control.
- **Kaen no Kuni** receives the gods with ritual honor and restraint. Divine presence is respected, but interference in mortal affairs remains strictly forbidden by cultural law.
- **Viridalis** reacts in two voices: Sylvari elders resist divine presence as disruptive to natural balance, while Therion populations welcome the gods as living stewards and protectors.
- **Aerion** witnesses gods manifesting upon sky-islands and open air, inspiring renewed spiritual philosophy centered on vigilance rather than worship.
- **Aquaris** records the first sustained underwater divine manifestation, strengthening Nerai faith and transforming sections of the Abyssal Palace into living sanctuaries.
- **Umbra Court** reacts with caution and secrecy. While publicly respectful, Vanyr houses quietly fear divine scrutiny, and Erekar contracts grow more restrained under watchful eyes.
- **Thundarkar Range** welcomes the gods as ancient equals. Durakken traditions treat them as powerful kin rather than masters, leading to mutual respect and limited cooperation.
- **Frosthelm Reach** greets the gods through ancestral rites. Jarls view their return as a test of strength and honor, believing divine aid must be earned, not given freely.
- **Aetherflux** is shaken profoundly. Gods refuse to endorse soul-based experimentation, forcing the nation to confront its ethical legacy and sparking renewed reform movements.

### Spiritual Restoration

- The Spirit Realm stabilizes with the return of the Goddess of Finality, who resumes guiding lost souls and sealing lingering echoes of the Sundering. Ghostly manifestations decrease across Vaeloran.
- Brannok's role evolves into that of a bridge between eras, reminding gods of mortal resilience and mortals of divine compassion without supremacy.
- Public perception of Brannok shifts fully—from a god who stayed behind, to the symbol of continuity between divine absence and return.

### New Understanding

- By the end of the age, gods are no longer distant myths nor absolute rulers. They are present, limited, compassionate forces—part of the world, not above it.
- The era closes with a shared understanding: Vaeloran belongs to mortals, but it is not abandoned by the divine.
