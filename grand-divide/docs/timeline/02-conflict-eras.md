# Age of Skirmishes & Fractures

## 251 to 400 – Age of Skirmishes

### The Valken Rebellion

- Eximus achieves partial attunement to the Lightning Shard, rebelling against Aetherflux and igniting a civil war between the Valken and their creators.
- Large portions of Aetherflux are devastated by sabotage, rogue constructs, and unstable aetheric infrastructure, permanently damaging its image as a unified nation.
- Several Aetherflux city-states declare temporary independence to avoid Valken conscription and soul-binding practices; most are later forcibly reabsorbed.

### Continental Reactions

- Frosthelm experiences internal fractures as jarls debate intervention versus isolation, nearly dissolving the Northern Hall.
- Nerai maritime councils impose a short-lived embargo on Aetherflux after Valken attacks on trade convoys, leading to isolated naval clashes.
- Viridalis border wardens clash repeatedly with Erekar mercenary bands moving through forest fringes, prompting stricter Sylvari isolation.
- A Halvyr-led attempt to enforce emergency Concordant law fails when multiple nations openly refuse compliance, weakening Concordant authority.
- Ideological conflict erupts within the Lumineth Sanctum between reformist clergy and traditional theocrats over the ethics of Luxmetal creation.
- Durakken of the Thundarkar Range refuse military construction requests, declaring neutrality in civil conflicts and straining long-standing alliances.
- Internal shadow warfare breaks out within the Umbral Court as factions assassinate rivals over Erekar loyalty and influence.
- Aerion faces internal dissent when younger Windwing riders demand intervention against Eximus, but elder Skywardens reaffirm neutrality.

### Resolution

- Eximus is believed destroyed during a catastrophic Lightning Shard implosion; his core is presumed annihilated, and the Lightning Shard is once again free.
- The Valken civil war abruptly ends, leaving surviving Valken fragmented and leaderless.
- Valken are formally recognized as a people rather than constructs, though many nations impose strict restrictions on their existence.
- Widespread belief that the greatest threat has passed marks the end of the Age of Skirmishes — and the quiet beginning of deeper fractures.

## 401 to 550 – Age of Fractures

### Institutional Collapse

- The Concordant Plains lose their authority as multiple nations openly ignore rulings, treaties, and mediation efforts, reducing the Concordant Council to a symbolic body rather than an enforcing power.
- Former Valken territories splinter into protectorates, enclaves, and outlaw zones, with surviving Valken struggling to define identity, rights, and purpose without a unifying leader.
- Internal unrest spreads across major nations as post-war prosperity gives way to inequality, ideological divides, and political stagnation.

### National Divisions

- Aetherflux fractures into competing academic factions, some pushing ethical reform, others secretly continuing soul-based research despite bans.
- Lumineth Sanctum experiences its first open schism, as reformist clergy challenge the absolute authority of Luxmetal-backed theocrats, leading to quiet purges rather than open war.
- Umbral Court influence expands unchecked, but infighting between Vanyr houses escalates into prolonged shadow conflicts that destabilize their own power base.
- Erekar loyalty becomes fractured; some fully integrate into Umbral Court hierarchy, while others abandon contracts entirely, becoming feared free agents.
- Viridalis tightens isolation further after several internal revolts, with Sylvari guardians suppressing dissent to preserve the sanctity of the Verdant Sanctum.
- Frosthelm suffers generational divides, as younger jarls push for renewed alliances while elders cling to isolationist traditions born from the Shard War.
- Aerion remains outwardly neutral, but internal philosophical divisions grow between Skywardens who believe in detachment and riders who believe vigilance requires intervention.

### Societal Strains

- Trade routes falter as trust erodes, leading to localized famines, economic downturns, and growing resentment toward former allies.
- The Spirit Realm shows signs of instability once more, with Aelvar reporting irregular soul currents and echoes of unresolved deaths from the Shard War era.
- A series of failed summits held in Eldwyn Vale publicly demonstrate the inability of existing systems to restore unity, cementing the sense that the old order is broken.

### Seeds of Hope

- Near the end of the era, a cooperative effort between Aetherflux-Thundarkar engineers, Lumineth diplomats, and Aerion–Aquaris navigators restores a long-broken network of land, sky, and sea routes that had once connected fractured regions.
- Though modest in scale, the success proves that cooperation is still possible — not through Concordant authority, but through shared necessity and trust earned through action.
- The Age of Fractures ends with cautious optimism, as nations begin to believe that unity may yet be rebuilt, laying the groundwork for the next era.
