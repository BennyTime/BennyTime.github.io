# The Last Years

A comprehensive timeline of Vaeloran's history from the end of the Age of the Shard War to the present day.

## -150 to 0 – End of Age of the Shard War

- Shards start destabilizing, making surges of power that alter the world.
- The Spirit Realm starts overflowing thanks to the Shard War, making it so some souls don't pass on to their next life. This event is later dubbed **The Sundering**.
- Aquaris' Abyssal Palace separates from the mainland, becoming an underwater city.
- Aerion separates from the earth, creating the current sky islands. In its place, the lands become a barren desert, later becoming known as **Sunscorch Expanse**.
- Viridalis Isolates themselves from the world, using the Nature Shard's power to create the forests that protect it.
- The area north to Aerion freezes over thanks to the Ice Shard, later becoming the **Frosthelm Reach**.
- Erekar start appearing in the world, working as mercenaries that work from the shadows. Eventually they align themselves with the Umbra Court and the Vanyr.
- The Shadow Shard emits the greatest surge of power recorded in history, creating the veil of darkness over Umbra Court known as the **Eternal Night**.
- The gods remove themselves from the world. Brannok, God of Treaties and Peace stays behind while trying to mediate and becomes bound to the mortal world.
- The Concordant Plains are formed, becoming the world's peace hub.
- The Vaelari emerge from nowhere. They start stabilizing the shards, an act that would take 200 years to conclude.
- Year 0 marks the formal end of the Shard War, beginning the Early Concordant Era.

## 1 to 150 – Early Concordant Era

### Early Recovery (1-50)

- Early days of the Concordant Era start off with tension. Nations still don't trust each other.
- To ease the problems, the Eldwyn Vale creates the Adventurer's Hub and the Hall of Accord to unite both the leaders and the common man. It works.
- Therian villages in Viridalis consolidate under regional lords, forming the foundation of structured governance amid the chaos.
- Kaen no Kuni martial academies are rebuilt under the eye of the Lord of that time, codifying post-war combat doctrine focused on discipline over conquest.
- The first Luxmetal artifacts are forged in Lumineth Sanctum by Forge Priests, marking the beginning of sanctified material craft.

### Rebuilding (51-100)

- The Lumineth Sanctum becomes a Theocracy post the discovery of Luxmetal, giving its power to the clergy.
- A joint Nerai–Hyran maritime council forms to regulate post-war sea routes and prevent renewed naval conflict.
- The first recorded case of Shard-induced mutation is documented in Aetherflux, prompting stricter ethical guidelines in Shard experimentation.
- Concord Bridge is built, connecting the Left continent to the Right one. The first Concordant Treaty is signed in it.
- The Concordant Council quietly debates whether Erekar qualify as a people or a threat. No consensus is reached; the issue is indefinitely deferred.
- Aerion establishes Aerion Prime, training the first Skyserpent riders and asserting aerial dominance.
- Brannok decides to change his domain, becoming the God of Festivities.

### Expansion Begins (101-150)

- Aetherflux creates one of the biggest points of free knowledge within the world – the **Aetherflux Academy**.
- The Shadow Rift Exchange expands operations, becoming the single largest black-market nexus in Vaeloran.
- The first stable aerial trade routes open between Aerion and Aetherflux, revolutionizing long-distance commerce.
- Aetherflux starts creating the Valken, automatons that use the souls of the dead as a power source created to work for the people. Their existence is hated by the Aelvar.
- Eximus, one of the Valken, was tasked with being the Valken's leader.
- Brannok's festivals spread continent-wide, becoming major cultural touchstones that soften post-war animosities.
- Erekar mercenary companies begin operating outside Umbral Court lands for the first time, despite Concordant bans.
- Kaen no Kuni codifies its Way of Contained Flame, banning conquest-based warfare.
- Shards are finally stabilized thanks to the Vaelari.
- Early Vanyr noble houses consolidate power within the Umbral Court, formalizing hereditary shadow influence.
- A failed assassination attempt on an Eldwyn Vale mediator is traced back to shadow intermediaries, straining Concordant–Umbral relations.
- The Concordant Council quietly debates limiting Umbral Court representation; no vote is taken.
- Aquaris completes fortified trade routes into Viridalis, enabling sustained naval commerce.
- First interactions with the Gods that separated themselves from the world are recorded. Beliefs of gods start to grow again.
- Eldwyn Vale hosts the First Continental Shard Congress, marking the symbolic height of cooperation — and the end of unquestioned expansion.
